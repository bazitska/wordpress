And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is one of my favorite niche holidays &#8211; World Wide Web Day &#8211; which serves to raise awareness about the origins of the World Wide Web project. WordPress, as part of Web 2.0, only ever had a chance to exist because the web, as we have come to know it exists. So in order to mark this nerdy day on the WP Briefing, I invited a number of community members to share a bit about how WordPress has been a part of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s do some introductions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:01:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/awarner20/">Adam Warner</a>, and I&#8217;m originally from a small town in west Michigan, now residing in Orlando, Florida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:01:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/">Alicia Orrù</a>. I&#8217;m Italian. I was born in the beautiful island of Sardinia, but I&#8217;ve been living in Spain in the province of Barcelona for 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal 00:01:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/thewebprincess/">Dee Teal</a>; Dee is short for Denise. I&#8217;m from New Zealand, but I live In Melbourne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:01:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, my name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/femkreations/">Femy Praseeth</a>. I was born and raised in India and now live in San Jose, California, with my family and cuddly Doodle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:01:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jillbinder/">Jill Binder</a>, and I&#8217;ve just moved back to Vancouver, Canada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:01:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/mariaojob/">Mary Job</a>. I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2015, and I&#8217;m from Nigeria. I&#8217;m from the Western part of Nigeria. Ijebu precisely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:01:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/onealtr/">Oneal Rosero</a>. I am from the Philippines and I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2007.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe</strong> <strong>00:02:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamsirotee/">Theophilus Adegbohungbe</a> . And I&#8217;m from Ilesa, Osun State in Nigeria. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:02:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ugyensupport/">Ugyen Dorji</a> and I&#8217;m from Bhutan. And I&#8217;m working with WordPress for more than five years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I enjoy the most about being part of any community is being able to see how people change and grow over time as they learn and gain confidence in their own expertise. So a favorite early question is naturally, ‘How has WordPress changed your World?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:02:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress changed my world in many ways. But, uh, starting from the moment, it allowed me to become part of a global connected and welcome community. I started using WordPress as a blogger many, many years ago, but it was in 2015 that I started working behind the scenes of WordPress with a plugin company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was the moment when everything changed, basically, because I realized that WordPress was much more than a CMS for creating websites. It was a world full of opportunities for networking, making new friends and walking a new professional path as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:03:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview, I was asked many questions about WordPress and although I had a basic understanding of WordPress, I struggled to give detailed answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that interview, I resolved to develop my skills and learn as much about WordPress as possible. A few months passed and I received a call from ServeMask In, [who] had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration plugin. They offered me a position which fulfilled my wish to work with WordPress full time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because of that, I am now an active contributor to the WordPress community as bread and butter, with the best career in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:04:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are very familiar with my country, Nigeria things here, it&#8217;s not as smooth as it is in other parts of the world. That is, when you are done in school in my university, you have to find means of surviving yourself.&nbsp; There is nothing like the government have work for you. There is nothing like you finish our institution and you get job instantly. So it&#8217;s very tough here. And, year by year, schools keep producing graduates with no companies to employ them and no government job again as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I personally, I was able to gain freedom from this with the help of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:04:51]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress completely changed my work life. I started working independently. I started freelancing with agencies and designers and, uh, building websites from their web designs. And this was around the time my son was born. Actually, he was in elementary school and I think this was around 2014 or so. I started working remotely when remote was not even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were very few companies that let you work from home and remote was not a mainstream thing at all, but with WordPress, I could set my own working hours while my son was in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:29]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, my preferred follow-up question of, ‘How did you hear about us?’ or ‘How did you connect to this global community?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:05:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, actually what I love about WordPress is that it&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s not a business. It&#8217;s not a company. It&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s a community that&#8217;s always ready to help support, teach and encourage people. That&#8217;s how I felt when I joined the community. There&#8217;s always somebody who has your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always somebody who&#8217;s going to guide you. There&#8217;s always an expert who will take your hand and lead you into the beauty that is WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:06:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that I connect with the global community these days are one, of course, is .org Slack. Another of course is Twitter as there&#8217;s a very active WordPress community there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with WordCamps all over the globe. I&#8217;m lucky enough to have been able to travel to several hundred WordCamps through the years in the US and abroad. And that&#8217;s one of the most rewarding parts is meeting people from all over the world and you see really how small and the world really is and how similar we really all are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:06:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not until 2020. I don’t know if you know this lady, a very vibrant lady in WordPress. She&#8217;s from Nigeria; her name is Mary Job, and she&#8217;s really promoting WordPress here. So it was through her that I got to know about the community. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:06:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work is the global WordPress community. So we hold our three programs for the global WordPress community, and we are always trying to reach more and more countries. For quite a while, it was very North America-heavy, and then I made some efforts to expand. And it&#8217;s very exciting that this year, some contributors in our team have actually launched an Asia Pacific branch of our group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we have two meetings every other week where we have the America/Europe and the APAC, and we&#8217;ve also been able to reach other countries as well, but we typically reach something like between 20 and 50 countries a year, depending on the year. So a hundred percent global. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has WordPress, either the CMS or the project, made you feel more connected? And are there any surprising connections that came from WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal&nbsp; 00:07:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the surprising connections I think that have come from WordPress have been the fact that I feel like I&#8217;ve got friends all over the world. And a lot of those have come out of community involvement and from contributing. That I could go to a, a meetup pretty much anywhere in the world and probably find somebody I know, or at least a second degree connection of somebody that I haven&#8217;t, you know, that I might not have met, but know somebody that I know. And certainly that happens fairly regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:08:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress. The WordPress project, the community, has made me feel connected in a huge way, because I am literally surrounded by everything WordPress. So I like how, when you meet somebody who does WordPress, there&#8217;s this instant, ‘Oh, we&#8217;re brothers,’ or&nbsp; ‘Oh, we&#8217;re sisters!’ You know? There&#8217;s that feeling? That&#8217;s how I feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see somebody who does WordPress, as I do, I&#8217;m like, ‘Oh yeah, we&#8217;re, kin.’ You know? We are family. That&#8217;s how I feel when I meet people who do WordPress. And I&#8217;ve met quite a number of people who do WordPress from like around the world. Like I have a friend here, he&#8217;s from the Benin Republic, and we host started a dinner on Friday night and one of my guests was asking me, ‘How did you guys meet?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, ‘Oh yeah, we work in the same WordPress ecosystem.’ He attended our WordCamp, we became friends, and we just literally became really good friends. So I have tons of people that I&#8217;ve met like that I hold in high esteem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:09:12]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Meetups are the seeds that lead to the growth of WordPress communities. WordCamp is a platform for plugin and theme developers to meet WordPress users and website developers. It&#8217;s a great environment where many incredible discussions about WordPress takes place. With each WordCamp there is a &#8220;tribe&#8221; meeting, where I think people [can] get more connected. It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity for aspiring computer engineers, generators and get to showcase their talent and meet each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the project level, it has given me the opportunity to feel like an active part of a global project. The idea that I can give my contribution to making the web a better place &#8211; it’s amazing. And I do so with the Translation team, so making WordPress accessible to all the people that use the core plugins and themes in Italian, and prefer to do that in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What area of the WordPress world is most important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:10:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a little bit of a passion for diversity in tech and diversity in WordPress, specifically around events. And so, here&#8217;s a chance to name the three programs that we&#8217;ve been working on this year. So as mentioned a few times, we have our <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/">Diverse Speaker Workshop</a> that helps people go from not even having the thought that people could step up on stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second program is because of the pandemic. There was no longer the straight path from taking our workshop to speaking, because we used to hold them or people used to hold them for their WordCamps and meetups. And so it was like, okay, you&#8217;ve taken. Apply for our next WordCamp or meetup. But during the pandemic, that wasn&#8217;t a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have this amazing channel that we welcome everyone to join, allies and people from underrepresented groups who are interested in speaking or interested in supporting people and speaking. And that&#8217;s the Diverse Speaker channel <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H">diverse-speaker-support</a> channel on the Make WordPress slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third program is, and we, we went through a name change recently. So I&#8217;ll try to remember the new change it&#8217;s Organizing Inclusive and Diverse WordPress Events. And this is for WordCamp and meetup organizers to learn. We&#8217;ve learned over the last couple years, how important it is to create inclusive spaces and be good allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do we actually do that? And a few of us created a very action oriented workshop in 2019 for WCUS, and that is now the basis of the work that we are bringing to people and people are loving it.. We&#8217;ve had people report a 40%, self-report 40%, increase in feeling prepared to create an inclusive event from before and after taking that workshop, which is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, that’s my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:12:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really love helping the WP Diversity team. I love running the workshops. I love running the workshops for myself, because I used to do training for software back before the pandemic. I used to train up to a thousand people a year in person, sometimes like 500 people in a room at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course I had to shift. I had to pivot to online training, which is what the training team has brought for me. And the focus on the diversity. I like running the workshops. I like running workshops for different groups, different countries, because it&#8217;s nice to meet new people. It&#8217;s nice to hear about their culture, about the limitations that people have in Africa with connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they, they resort to using WhatsApp on their phone in order to do a meetup. That&#8217;s how they do their, their meetings, their discussions. It&#8217;s unlike other countries where we can do video calls. They have to use their mobile phones because connectivity isn&#8217;t accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places like in the Philippines that get affected when it starts to rain a little bit, we lose our internet. So we have backups and our backups have backups. So there are many things that you learn that are different when you&#8217;re living in the city, when you&#8217;re living in the provinces, in the country. So it&#8217;s so many things that you learn about people and how they&#8217;re able to adapt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:13:35]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling end users to reach their goals. And whether that means participating in contributing to the software, to the Core software itself, in terms of UI/UX usability. That can include participating in the community and sharing your knowledge proactively with users who may be new to the platform, or have used WordPress for a while, but now want to step up their game, get a little deeper into using their websites as a tool for growth, for whatever business that they&#8217;re in. So, I mean, overall, the, the most important part of the WordPress world to me are the end users. And, you know, there, there is this quote unquote inner circle of WordPress community people. People who are involved in .org, people who contribute to the software, people who contribute to the 20 plus make.wordpress.org teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those we have to keep in mind, are not the average user by and far. They are not the typical user that hears the word WordPress and then goes out and searches it and then has to figure out how to use it. So I think user experience is probably the most important part for me and making sure that any of that innate knowledge that we have in that inner circle of WordPress because many of us have been using it for so long, keeping in mind that is not the norm. And it&#8217;s not the scale at which WordPress is used and, and making sure we translate complex concepts down to a layperson&#8217;s terms that might not be as familiar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have always found so fascinating about the web and WordPress’ role in it is how it has made the world simultaneously smaller and bigger. By giving voices to the voiceless we help each other find our community niches regardless of where they are in the world. Some of your closest friends could be people you would never meet in your own neighborhood. Well, let’s hear what some of our community members had to say about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Tea 00:15:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the thing that has been most empowering is, is coming into the project either in terms of contributing time and efforts to the community, which is where most of my contribution has been &#8211; has always been about this is a really cool thing, and I really want to build this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ll put my time and efforts into building WordPress. Not for me, but because I see its value and I see its community and I see that the contribution that it&#8217;s making to the world and I, and that&#8217;s really important. But finding that on the other side of that was a huge amount of personal benefit for me in my career, in the friendships that I&#8217;ve made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel like if I had been approaching the community with, I want a better career, I wanna meet all of these people and I want, and I want all of this. From, “I want” for me, instead of, I want for this project, for the community and effectively for the world with that, you know, that whole democratized, the democratizing of publishing is this thing that serves the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s been the key for me is that I absolutely have reaped amazing benefits from it, but it came out of that sense of, I see this value here and I want to contribute to that because it&#8217;s gonna have value, not just for me, but for a whole slew of people. And so, uh, you know, for much, much bigger impact than just on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that&#8217;s the important thing for me is that sense of, if you approach it with that attitude of what can I do to help? It&#8217;s amazing what you will find yourself helped with in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you enjoyed this tour of WordPress in the World Wide Web. I want to share a big thank you to all of the folks who contributed to our little WordPress Briefing celebration of World Wide Web Day today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. So firstly, we&#8217;ve got a couple of updates from our upcoming flagship events. WordCamp US has announced a speaker support fund specifically for historically underrepresented speakers at the event. You can donate to the fund on the page if you&#8217;d like, and there are also directions on how to request support, if you are part of an underrepresented group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the folks over at WordCamp Asia, the call for speakers is live. That&#8217;s taking place in February, 2023. But it&#8217;s never too early to brush up those presentations and get them submitted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next big thing is that there are some changes coming to the WordPress mobile app. A lot of the Jetpack functionality will be removed from it, so this is going to have a little bit of an effect on daily users of the app, but it will also have an effect on regular contributors. I&#8217;ll have a link to the full write up in the show notes so that you don&#8217;t have to guess or hold it all in your memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, this excellent design that you see on wordpress.org/news is finally making its way out to the next parts of the wordpress.org website. Before you know, it, there will be a fresh looking homepage as well as few other pages and then… to infinity and beyond (or something like that).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And next up I&#8217;ll be taking just a mid-year break from the podcast. And so the next time that I actually see you again, will be in September.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"13198";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:72:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"People of WordPress: Carla Doria";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/people-of-wordpress-carla-doria/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 19:00:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Features";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"General";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Interviews";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"HeroPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"People of WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13201";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:324:"In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

It gave her a career and a community, in which she she would organize the first WordCamp in her city, Cochabamba, and the first in Bolivia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla studied industrial engineering and has a master’s degree in environmental studies.<br>Her first experience with WordPress was when she decided to start a small business designing and selling cushions and bedclothes.&nbsp;While Carla sat in the small store she had rented, hoping that people stopping at the shop windows would step in to buy something, she decided she needed to create a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>First steps with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla had no budget to hire somebody, but she felt confident&nbsp; she could learn things on her own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Learning to use WordPress requires no code skills or a technical background. It needs an adventurous and playful spirit.” </p><cite>Carla Doria</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She had always been studious, and decided she would figure out how to build a website herself. Carla ended up building a simple blog with WordPress. At the time, she didn’t even have a budget to buy a custom domain, so she used a free subdomain.<br><br>“Learning to use WordPress is easy. It requires no code skills or a technical background at all. It only needs an adventurous and playful spirit,” said Carla</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were no profits, and any income mainly went to pay the store’s rent. At the time, her previous company contacted her for a job opening that matched her profile. Carla needed that income and decided to closed the store and forget about being an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in employee mode, Carla started her new job as a technical writer for a software development company. Since Carla had completed her master’s degree in the UK, she was proficient in English. Her close affinity for computers and technology made it easy for her to translate complex software jargon into simple tutorial steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Carla got more interested in technical writing and started to improve her writing skills. This reconnected her with her previous enthusiasm for writing, and she decided to channel that interest into a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diving deep</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating her blog helped her become more familiar with WordPress and building websites. In 2015, Carla blogged about writing, her thoughts, book reviews, and everything that came to mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through looking for answers to specific issues using her WordPress blog, Carla found the support forums a useful place to go. Soon she realized that she could also help answer other people’s questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="900" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-13189" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla began checking the forums as a hobby. She liked that she was able to help people and learn more while doing so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of surfing social media during her work breaks, Carla focused on checking the WordPress forums. Through this she learnt about a support job in one of the global firms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt the job was made for her and was excited to support people in building their websites with WordPress. The role offered the possibility to work remotely and travel while still working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years as a technical writer, her career felt stuck. She was certain she did not want to return to any job related to industrial engineering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla did not get through the selection process the first time. But after nearly 18 months between three applications and learning HTML and CSS, Carla finally secured a support job in 2016. With this job, WordPress became her main source of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Leading a local WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the job, Carla learned about the WordPress communities around the world and WordCamps. But when somebody asked about the WordPress community where Carla lived, she didn’t know what to say. Was there a community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She discovered no local group existed, so she researched what was needed to setup a meetup. Carla discussed the idea with others, but hesitated as she thought it would require an expert WordPress developer to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after trying to gauge interest, Carla realized that the only way to find community members was to start a community. In 2017, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Cochabamba-WordPress-Meetup/">WordPress community in Cochabamba</a> was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="684" height="391" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=684%2C391&#038;ssl=1" alt="The theme preview screen in the WordPress Cochabamba meeting on creating your website with blocks." class="wp-image-13236" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?w=684&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>WordPress meeting in Cochabamba explored creating your website with blocks</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The group has had ups and downs, probably similar to any other community. Although Cochabamba is not a big city, they had issues finding a location that was free and available to anyone who wanted to join. People came with different levels of knowledge, from people with&nbsp;vast experience with WordPress to people with no experience but who wanted to learn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community grew during the pandemic, as meetups went online and people from other cities in Bolivia were able to attend. After restrictions were lifted, there was a lot of excitement amongst members to meet each other in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Giving back through speaking</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="900" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1" alt="Carla reading a book under a tree" class="wp-image-13191" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The community also helped Carla to develop a new skill in public speaking. She applied to be a speaker at WordCamp Mexico <a href="https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2019/">2019</a> and <a href="https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2020/">2020</a>, <a href="https://guayaquil.wordcamp.org/2019/">WordCamp Guayaquil 2019</a>, and <a href="https://colombia.wordcamp.org/2020/">WordCamp Colombia in 2020</a>. Her confidence grew while she enjoyed connecting with other communities and meeting people who were on similar pathways. Not all of them were developers, as she had presumed.

She had never imagined organizing any WordCamp, and through this having the experience to talk to sponsors and contact companies, and lead a group of people with different talents and backgrounds. Carla felt she had learnt so much from the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to WordPress, Carla found a job she enjoyed, was able to work remotely, and help build something in her community to help people learn skills and find career opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla feels grateful for all she has been able to do thanks to WordPress. She said: “WordPress has led me to find good jobs. It also has allowed me to contribute to a community of friends that love learning about WordPress.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Alison Rothwell (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpfiddlybits/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>wpfiddlybits</a>), Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), and Surendra Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>sthakor</a>) for work on this feature, and to all the contributors who helped with the series recently.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an open source software project and, like many other open source software projects, has an entire community of people who show up to help improve it however they can. Most of you probably use WordPress every day in some way. And I&#8217;m going to assume that since you listen to this podcast, you&#8217;re also interested in how this all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I mention practically every episode is that WordPress works and continues to work because of generous contributions from people all around the world. I consider my work with WordPress to be my way of giving back for everything that this software enabled me and my family to do. But I once was a first-time contributor, and I remember what it felt like before I knew everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like it moved at the speed of light and that I could never tell what to do now, let alone what to do next. And that everyone around me basically already knew everything. And if you are feeling that way right now, I encourage you to take a big deep breath [breathe] and let me help you get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:43]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a roadmap sort of person. So I&#8217;m going to start by sharing the stages I&#8217;ve observed for folks who are contributing to open source. That way, you can tell where you are right now, which spoiler alert is probably a bit further along than you realize. Then I&#8217;ll give you some questions you can ask yourself for each stage to figure out what is a good fit for you. Think of it as a guided exploration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, the five stages. So these are they:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Connecting</strong>. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first learning about the community. You know WordPress exists, but now you&#8217;ve just discovered that the community exists. That&#8217;s where you are.&nbsp;</li><li>The second phase is <strong>Understanding</strong>. It&#8217;s when you are researching the community, like, you know it exists, you think you want to give back, and so you&#8217;re trying to figure out where everything is.&nbsp;</li><li>The third phase is what I call <strong>Engaging</strong>. It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first interacting, you&#8217;ve downloaded the CMS, you have figured out which team you think you&#8217;re interested in, and you&#8217;re headed to events or meetings or whatever.&nbsp;</li><li>The fourth stage is one that I refer to as <strong>Performing</strong>. And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re gonna volunteer and you&#8217;re gonna take some action. You&#8217;re going to like a contributor day or running a release or whatever. I think that&#8217;s probably not the first place you land, running a release is probably a lot, but, you know, coordinating work on the release or something like that.&nbsp;</li><li>And then phase five, which is the <strong>Leading</strong> phase. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re taking responsibility for things getting done.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:08]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get any further, there are four important things to remember about those stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to remember is that there is no set time between any of those stages. You can start in one and then three years later go to the next one, or you can start in one and go into the next stage tomorrow. The next thing to know is that each stage builds on the one before it. In my observation, anytime I have seen a contributor who feels like they&#8217;re really struggling, it&#8217;s because they skipped a stage in there, which really causes some trouble for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing to remember is that not everyone will make it through these stages, which is okay. The majority of the community stops at three. Most contributors stop at four. And that is perfectly fine. That is expected. That is normal and completely in line with what we expect from contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and the final thing to remember about that list of the phases is that very few people make it into that leadership stage. If we assume, like I do, that 1% of the people who are using WordPress also show up and contribute back to WordPress, then it&#8217;s kind of safe to assume also that about 1% of those people who have shown up to contribute to WordPress are moving into a space where they feel like they&#8217;re willing to take responsibility for making sure things get done in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we all collectively feel responsible for WordPress&#8217;s success, but in that leadership area, you&#8217;re kind of taking responsibility for 40% of the web or whatever&#8217;s going on there. And not a lot of people make it there, and that is completely fine, too. So that&#8217;s our basic terminology today. Those are the caveats that go with our basic terminology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most difficulties that arise for new contributors happen because a stage got skipped somewhere along the way. It&#8217;s almost never intentional, but from what I&#8217;ve observed, that&#8217;s what makes it really difficult to get started and what makes it difficult to keep going once you&#8217;ve kind of already gotten in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, all right. Big breath, folks with me again [breathe]. Alright, it&#8217;s guided exploration time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First phase, the connecting phase. Remember, this is where you&#8217;ve just learned the community exists, people are talking about it, you don&#8217;t know much more. The first step for you is asking yourself what it is you could do. Or if there&#8217;s a project out there that looks particularly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:36]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can ask yourself questions, like, am I a writer? And if I am a writer, do I write technical or prose. The other thing you can ask is, am I a PHP developer, a JavaScript developer, Python, Go; which language am I writing in because I find it most beautiful. Another thing you can ask yourself is, am I a teacher or a mentor, or do I just generally like to be a mighty helper? And I like to make sure that things keep running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;ve asked yourself those things, it&#8217;s on to phase two, the understanding phase. This is when you&#8217;re looking around at this new-to-you community to see what is happening where. So you take a look at the teams that are around, you think about whatever it was you said you were good at in the last question and you look at which teams might be a good fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you said that you&#8217;re a good technical writer, then Docs probably is for you. Have you been training others to use WordPress for years? Then you might wanna look into Training. There are a lot of other things, obviously, like if you think you&#8217;re good at working with code PHP or JavaScript, you&#8217;re probably gonna end up in Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are particularly good at any of the other tech stacks that we have around in our Trac area or an Openverse, then that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll land over there. You have design options. Like if design is really your thing, we have a Design team, but we also have a Themes team. There are plenty of places that you can land depending on what it is that you feel like you are the best at and could really help the WordPress project. And so that&#8217;s your phase two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have gotten a good guess at a team, we&#8217;re gonna swing through to phase three, which is the engaging phase. This is the phase that is the scariest for most people, but it&#8217;s okay. I am here for you. I am here for you in this podcast. So you have figured out what you want to do in order to contribute, and you&#8217;ve got a sense for the team that looks right. There are two things that you do next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that you can go to a meeting. There are many kinds of meetings. There are team meetings, bug scrubs, and testing sessions, but they&#8217;re all in Slack, which means that you can attend one from anywhere. When they kick off, you wave, you introduce yourself, you let everybody know that you&#8217;re there and you&#8217;re observing. Folks will welcome you and just kind of give you some concept of what they&#8217;re working on. Easy as that. You&#8217;ve done your first time meeting attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good option is to keep an eye out for specific events. Some of those events happen online, like Global Translation Day. But also some of them happen in person like, Meetups or WordCamps. And there again, you show up, you wave, you introduce yourself, see if you can make a connection or two, let people know that you&#8217;re new and you&#8217;re just trying to figure out where you are and what you wanna do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made it now, all the way to phase four, the performing phase, then give yourself a little pat on the back! Figuring out where you want to go and who your friendly faces are is the biggest challenge when you get started. So congratulations!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:37]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase four is the phase where you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re brave enough to volunteer &#8211; to do some contribution. You&#8217;re volunteering your time. That&#8217;s where you are now. So oddly enough, you start this phase by assigning yourself something, assigning yourself, a task. This seems counterintuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this feeling that you can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re gonna do something. That you can&#8217;t just assign something to yourself and say that you&#8217;re gonna do it. But in open source projects, you always can. You find a task where you&#8217;re comfortable, and you just mention that you would like to give it a try while the team is having their weekly meeting. And it&#8217;s simple as that. And not big things either. Like organizing an event or maintaining a component, those are probably too big for your first time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking things like, &#8216;I will test that patch that you mentioned in the meeting.&#8217; Or &#8216;I will review the docs and make sure that they&#8217;re up to date with the most recent release.&#8217; Or &#8216;I can help run meetings for the next release.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have phase five, where you just repeat phase four until you are leading something! And I don&#8217;t mean leading in the 1950s sort of way, where you have like a corner office and you&#8217;re ordering people around. I mean, in the warm, inviting millennial way where you&#8217;re leading by inspiring people to do something or you&#8217;re leading because you make sure that the meeting happens every single week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you&#8217;re leading because you added screenshots to tickets that needed testing and so you moved something forward in a way that was helpful. Easy peasy. You can go to your first contributor today or a WordPress Slack meeting and just be a contributor by the time you leave, right? You might feel like ‘easy as that isn&#8217;t quite the right set of words right there. And as a matter of fact, you might be thinking to yourself, this woman is just plain wrong. It could not possibly be that easy. And I agree. It really isn&#8217;t literally quote-unquote just that easy. Just like handing someone a notebook and a pen will not instantly make them an award-winning novelist, handing someone a wordpress.org profile and credentials to Slack won&#8217;t instantly make them a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both of those examples, what makes someone good is the ability to try and fail and still be encouraged to try again. So if it&#8217;s been a while since you contributed and you&#8217;re thinking about returning, or if you&#8217;ve been listening to me for a while and you&#8217;re ready to give this contribution thing a try, I hope this helps you to feel brave enough to try and brave enough to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I encourage you to be brave enough to try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:20]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at our small list of big things. My friends, we have a Performance team. This team has been a working group for a long time and is focused on some deep, inner workings of WordPress and its surrounding ecosystem to make sure that we are as fast and slick as possible. You can check them out on make.wordpress.org/performance, their brand new site, and see when they&#8217;re meeting, what they&#8217;re aiming to get into the WordPress 6.1 release, and if that&#8217;s something that you would like to contribute to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there&#8217;s a brand new call out for testing. This time it&#8217;s focused on templates and retroactively applying them to an entire category of posts. So it&#8217;s a little bit workflow testing, a little bit technology testing, and we could really use your help in bug hunting for both of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is that you know since contribution is obviously the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, we are looking for table leads for WordCamp US’ contributor day that&#8217;s coming up in September. There&#8217;s a whole blog post about it, I&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes so that you&#8217;ll have all the info and can raise your hand if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:25]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of things that I&#8217;ll have in the show notes, I also am going to put like a contributor quizlet guide thing. If the guided, figuring out of the teams in the phase two section, if that didn&#8217;t make any sense to you and you just need something to direct you specifically to potential teams, I&#8217;m gonna link to the contributor kind of sorting hat quiz that came out with WordCamp Europe.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m talking about Five for the Future– again. Before we get stuck right into the heart of it, 10 episodes ago, in episode 25, I focused on the Five for the Future initiative and I recommend that you listen to that before you join me in today&#8217;s episode. It&#8217;s only eight minutes and it gives you a history of the Five for the Future initiative, as well as some information on the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then goes on to talk about some of the original intentions behind that original initiative. The reason I bring this back up today is partially because one, I will talk about both the program and the initiative it&#8217;s based on literally anytime. I believe strongly that they are both a vital part of what will result in a triumph of the commons of WordPress, and keep this empowering project around for years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also bring it up today because there&#8217;s conversation about a post I published a couple of months back that has generated some dialogue around the intentions of this catchy call to contribution. So to make sure that as we move through this discussion together, we are working with as much factual information as possible, I present to you some facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, the pillars of this initiative. The 5% in Five for the Future is aspirational. Contribution to open source is a question and indication of privilege. So the 5% is not a requirement, but rather it&#8217;s an aim. It could refer to 5% of your time or 5% of your resources, or just any amount of your time or resources around. Regardless of how you&#8217;re defining it, it is an aspiration, not a requirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second pillar, pledges show your intention and whatever contributions you are able to offer after you&#8217;ve made your pledge are always welcome. No one is out there checking for 100% completion of the hours that you intended to give back to WordPress versus the hours that you actually succeeded at giving back to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many volunteers that make sure that this project is running and functional and has plenty of people knowing how to get things done and how to teach others how to get things done. It&#8217;s all coming from generosity of heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:52]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of generosity, the third thing that is important about this initiative is that it insists on and wants to celebrate a culture of generosity. Beyond the concept of a pledge, is the idea of generous collaboration toward the long term health and stability of our project for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As contributors, we understand that we are greater than the sum of our parts and what we build <em>within</em> WordPress empowers those who build <em>with</em> WordPress. So those are the pillars that went into that initial thought, that opening Five for the Future call to action that Matt gave to everybody in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I want to share with you some of the pillars of the program that has grown up around it. So the Five for the Future initiative, if you&#8217;re not familiar, was started in 2014 and is a grand call to all of us to remember to give back to the shared commons of WordPress. Its aim was to help guard against what is called the “tragedy of the commons,” where resources are continually taken out and not necessarily reinvested in. No one&#8217;s necessarily putting anything back into those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:06]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the starting point for all of this. So the program, the Five for the Future program, in 2018 was built as a collaborative effort with full participation and buy-in from the contributors who were active in the project at the time. It allowed anyone to raise their hands, to show support of WordPress via a pledge and also started a multi-year discussion of how to define contributions in a way that let us automatically provide props and therefore more effectively put badges on people&#8217;s wordpress.org profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in 2019, there was an additional pilot of the program, which kind of offered some team structure, which was intended to not only take on work that I don&#8217;t like to ask volunteers to do, but also to provide some checks and balances to an absolute raft of sponsored contributor hours that we had started to see show up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us then to the post that I mentioned at the start. Knowledgeable supporters of the WordPress open source project have debated next iterations to Five for the Future activity and programming. So, to bring the conversation to a central set of questions, or rather to bring the conversation to a central spot, I raised these two questions. One, what activities can we see inside our contributor networks? So wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, the Rosetta sites that we have, Slack, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what activities can we see inside the contributor networks that we can flag to enable easier distribution of props and therefore badges? The second question is, what activities can we see also in those contributor networks that appear to be contributions, but in the end are only benefiting the person or company that provides the contributions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth that discussion then also raised a third question that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve even started to tackle, which is what about the activities that are not in the contributor network, but still do move WordPress forward? Cause there are so, so many of those things and it&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t have an answer and just so that I don&#8217;t leave you all with a series of questions for which there are no answers provided in this particular podcast, I do have a few answers for questions that I have seen floating around this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first question is actually a bunch of questions. There are like three parts to it. What are props, who gives props, and who tracks them? So ‘props’ is a term used in WordPress to describe shared recognition of a contribution. Think of it as like a hat tip or kudos or an assist. However you think about it, it&#8217;s recognition of the other people who helped to solve a problem along the way. That is what props are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that question is who gives props and historically developers have given props, which tends to mean that it&#8217;s mostly developers who get props. But now, also, any team rep during a release cycle can provide props to folks on their team, volunteers on their team who were really helpful during the course of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And recently we also added the functionality for ad hoc props to be given in the Slack props channel, and those get added to your profile activity. So that someone can give you basically a public thanks for having helped on something that they were working on. And then that gets logged in your activity tracker on your WordPress.org profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final question in that first big question is who tracks these props? And the answer is human beings! Which is why folks feel like they have to do a ton of things before they even get props. And that&#8217;s also why I&#8217;d like to automate more and more of them so that you don&#8217;t have to do a ton of things in order for someone to show up and acknowledge that you are part of a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:51]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second question that I&#8217;ve seen kind of running around is, where do props start? And that is a great question that has been asked year after year. And one that I think we should continue to ask. The reality is that we won&#8217;t be able to see every contribution to WordPress, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they aren&#8217;t valuable. And it doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building our culture of generosity helps us to better recognize and celebrate each other for all of our contributions, whether they are for a major release or a major event, or one of these new ad hoc props that you can offer to people. And if we see more and more of the same type of contributions being celebrated, then we can also work toward automating those as well, so that you don&#8217;t have to do a super ton of them before someone has noticed that you&#8217;ve done even one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third big question that has been running around is, what about the people who don&#8217;t want the props? If people want to be literally anonymous, then deletion requests are probably your way to go. But I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the question here. I think the question is what if a prop holds no intrinsic value to you and then, you know, I wanna thank you for that spirit of generosity. And I also wanna say that I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, all of these answers clarify what lies at the heart of what is intended with the Five for the Future initiative and the program that&#8217;s built on top of it. And why I care so much about fixing the ways we offer props to folks. For me, it&#8217;s not about assessing the worthiness of people or companies or any of their contributions. For me, it&#8217;s about reinvesting in the shared commons of the WordPress ecosystem, by finding a way that our economy can entice folks to put back into WordPress, something close to the benefit that they receive from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Thank you all for making it into the final stretches with me. These three things that I&#8217;m sharing also have companion blog posts to go with them because they are very big questions or very big features, very big plugin kind of things that we&#8217;re looking at. And so you&#8217;ll be able to find those in the show notes, or you can go to wordpress.org/news if you&#8217;re listening to this in a podcast player of your choice that is not wordpress.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one on my list is a new plugin. It is called Create Block Theme. And it&#8217;s gonna make it easier for theme builders to use the existing site editor tools to create new block themes. I&#8217;m very excited about this. Uh, you can find it on make.wordpress.org/themes. And I will also include a link to it in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If themes are not your area of expertise, but you are interested in documentation or the DevHub or to an extent design things, then the improvements that are being worked on for the DevHub are definitely in your area. That&#8217;s kind of a Meta task, but has a few other pieces involved as well. That can be found on make.wordpress.org/meta. But again, I will have a link to the very, very detailed blog post in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got a bunch of hypothetical changes that are being suggested for the WordPress developer docs, uh, especially when it comes to the function reference. And so there are gonna be some slight design questions, but not like, graphic design/visual design, more in the like, can humans read this design area of things? And so that will be a good one to look at. If you are sort of in the Meta or Documentation vein of things in the way that you like to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:011:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is about open sourcing theme designs. So open sourcing everything obviously is important to us. And the design tool that we use, this tool called Figma, is open to the public. And so it&#8217;s possible for folks to be able to kind of get in there and use and reuse any design elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a discussion happening over on make.wordpress.org/design about how that can and should look in the future. And so if design is definitely your area, and again, this kind of lines up with themes a little bit, then wander over into that one, for which there will also be a link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"13132";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:60:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"The Month in WordPress – June 2022";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2022/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 14:19:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Month in WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"month in wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13069";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:313:"With WordPress 6.1 already in the works, a lot of updates happened during June.

The potential and power of blogs would be an influence in the rest of his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1" alt="Leo sat in front of a pond.

In 2005, with the encouragement of his blog readers, he spent his school summer break in his room working on reducing his stutter. WordPress would be the tool that would enable him to connect with his blog readers and to express his creativity and thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making WordPress your own</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, Leo had opted for programming as one of his subjects. In 2008, he built his first website using WordPress for the students at the school. This was the first time he saw the real value of WordPress and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the following years, he increasingly spent time searching online for information on &#8216;Customising WordPress&#8217; and &#8216;Making WordPress your own&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo wanted to keep busy and as soon as he finished school, he applied for every entry-level web-related job that he could find. He was hired by a company for the role of webmaster for its Marketing team focused on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He continued to grow his skills as a WordPress developer with the help of useful documentation that he could find and through his helpful local WordPress Community. This helped him earn a living and support his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping yourself through helping others in the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Leo moved full-time to Cape Town, South Africa, and started as a developer at a web development agency, eventually progressing to its Head of Development and managing a small team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He chose WordPress as his main platform for development mainly because of the community behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“<em>Had it not been for those searches on how to make WordPress your own, my life would have turned out a lot differently</em>.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo felt he had a hurdle to overcome working in web sector. He didn’t feel like a ‘real developer’ being self-taught. However, through the community, he realized that there were many self-taught developers and he was not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside his development path, Leo faced a mental health journey. He had suffered from depression and found the community to be accepting and understanding of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Cape Town 2016, he stood in front of an audience and gave a talk: “<a href="https://wordpress.tv/2016/11/24/leo-gopal-the-wordpress-community-mental-wellness-and-you/">The WordPress Community, Mental Wellness, and You</a>”. Following this talk, he was greeted by many attendees who thanked him for talking so openly about mental health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Leo speaking at the podium at WordCamp Cape Town in 2016" class="wp-image-13023" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has been diagnosed with bipolar, previously known as manic depression. In 2017, he hit a low period and struggled to keep going. He found support and understanding in the community in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has openly written about his experiences with depression and started an initiative where topics of mental health and general wellbeing can be freely and non-judgmentally discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that by helping others, he is helping himself, every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has contributed to the community as a Co-organizer in South Africa for the 2016 and 2017 WordCamp Cape Town, WordPress Meetup Cape Town 2015 &#8211; 2016, and WordPress Durban 2017 – 2020. He has also spoken at a number of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining connections with people he had met through these events Leo felt was a great aid to his mental wellbeing during the Covid pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has contributed to core and plugins and believes that WordPress and its community make it extremely easy to contribute. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“<em>The cost to start contributing is extremely low &#8211; start now</em>”.</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When the ability to create and add patterns to the WordPress.org library came out in 2021, Leo used it almost immediately and created a <a href="https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/call-to-action-section-2/">call-to-action box</a> which could be used by both his clients and the community. He plans to release a few more complex patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yes, we can.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo’s mantra is “I can do it!”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Leo speaking at a WordCamp Cape Town in 2019" class="wp-image-13032" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?w=1944&amp;ssl=1 1944w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting over a stutter, overcoming poverty, being urgently self-taught, growing up in a country with “load shedding” electricity outages, and one of the slowest rated internet speeds in the developing world, and strengthening mental wellness are not easy feats., And yet, he knows he can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“<em>Never, ever think you do not have the &#8216;right&#8217; circumstances for success.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right my friends. So it&#8217;s been about a month since WordPress 6.0 came out and you know what that means. It means we are already looking at the next major WordPress release because,&nbsp; as most of you know, WordPress never sleeps. Y&#8217;all are honestly up and hustling like 24/7 as far as I can tell, which is great! And is one of the many benefits of being a global community, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, back to this major release. There was a high-level roadmap shared by Mattias Ventura at the start of June. And it lists some focus areas for the Block Editor, continued refinements to the template editor and navigation block, and some work on global styles and more / better blocks and design tools that are slated to ship with WordPress 6.1. From the WordPress core side, though, there are a couple hundred tickets that are milestoned for the next major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being milestoned for a release means that either a ticket wasn&#8217;t ready for the last release and was moved to the next available one, or a ticket has become ready for a release since the last major release occurred. That list as it stands might be a little bit too big for a single release. However, honestly, no list is too big if we have enough folks contributing.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve never contributed to a major release of WordPress before, and you&#8217;re interested to know how that works, there are some things to keep an eye out for over the next few weeks. We are in what is considered the planning phase for the next big release. And so there are two or three things you&#8217;re gonna see pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First is a planning kickoff post. That post gets published on make.wordpress.org/core, and it includes notes on volunteering for the release squad, some guesses at areas of focus based on the tickets that we&#8217;re seeing in track, a schedule, the whole kit, and caboodle. It&#8217;s all in there. If you are wanting to know how to lend a hand and how to take your first steps to core contribution, apart from the new contributor meeting that happens before the dev chat, that post is the place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org/core for that. And then the second thing that shows up in the planning phase for any major release is bug scrub and ticket triage meetings. Like I mentioned, there are the new contributor meetings where they scrub tickets and talk through the basics of what we&#8217;re seeing on good first bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mentioned that here often, I just mentioned it in the last, in the last bullet point, but there are also regular bug scrubs and ticket triaging sessions where a kind contributor chooses a set of tickets to review and then leads other contributors through the process of checking to see if a ticket is valid to see if it can be replicated to see if it has a patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are decisions that are blocking it and how to move those decisions forward, and generally just kind of discuss what else has to be done in order to take the ticket to the next step. Those get announced in the dev chat every Wednesday, but also there is a post that will go up on make.wordpress.org/core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I had a faster way to say that instead of just racing through the whole URL every time. But it&#8217;ll be okay. We&#8217;ll put it in the show notes in case you would rather just click some stuff. And the third thing to keep an eye out for. If development is not your thing, so writing code is not already part of your tool belt, that&#8217;s totally fine. There are many other important areas where you can contribute, too. Design, training, support, polyglots, marketing, documentation, and more. These teams all do work in and around a release that is vital to WordPress&#8217; overall success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:19]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a final thought of all. If that felt a little too intense if you want to see where this ship is headed, but you can&#8217;t quite commit to grabbing an oar today, that&#8217;s fine, too. The most important thing is that if you are a member of the community, as an extender or a user or a die-hard contributor, or a new contributor, the most important thing is that you have some general awareness of what the overall direction is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might do that by experimenting with blocks in your products or by testing screen readers against your workflow or even by setting aside an hour to participate in the latest testing prompt. Being aware of what&#8217;s happening in and around your area of the project will help to keep you kind of prepared and knowledgeable to lend a hand whenever it is that you are ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that then brings us to our small list of big things. My friends, registration is now open for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India. That&#8217;s taking place on September 24th and 25th. Uh, it&#8217;s happening over Zoom, so location or travel shouldn&#8217;t really be an obstacle for you. I&#8217;m going to leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. It should be an excellent opportunity that [the] WP Diversity initiative that WordPress has, that the community team helps to foster, is really an excellent experience. And so I hope that you register and attend that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second thing actually is a bit of a celebration. The Photo Directory recently hit a huge milestone of 3000 photos! And you also can submit your photos to wordpress.org/photos. If you feel so inclined to make a contribution of that type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:06:07]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things is actually kind of a, a WordPress tooltip a little bit of a WordPress project did-ya-know? So, there is a special channel in WordPress Slack for sharing thanks to folks who were especially helpful to you. It&#8217;s called the Props Channel. And when someone shares props with you, it even shows up in your activity on your wordpress.org profile. Pretty cool, huh?

It&#8217;s a big part of our business. And I think it&#8217;s like WordPress is a big part of all the hosting company, company’s, businesses, you know? So for us, it is like, we want to make it better. We want to give back. We want to understand, you know, where we can contribute the most. And we see it as a, you know, win, win, win situation for everyone, for clients, for the whole ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for us as a business, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Milana Cap </strong>00:00:32]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite WordPress component is WP CLI. That&#8217;s my crush, haha, because I love terminal. I love doing it. I&#8217;m not a really UI type of person, I get lost in UI. But in terminal, you just type command and it does what you want. And a WP CLI is much more powerful than WordPress dashboard. You can do so many things there and you can have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that&#8217;s my go-to tool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. And welcome to the WordPress Briefing– the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:36]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many people were at WordCamp Europe a couple of weeks ago. And at the end, Matt and I closed out the event sessions with a little question and answer time from the community. I was excited to see everyone and excited to answer their questions. But as with all spur of the moment answers, I experienced this <em>l&#8217;esprit de l&#8217;escalier </em>and I found that there were a few things that I would have answered a little more completely if I had taken more than two seconds to think about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I&#8217;m going to augment some of the answers from that session with a little more context and clarity. There was a question from Laura Byrne about favorite blocks in recent WordPress releases. And given that I was exclusively holding WordCamp Europe information in my brain at the time, I couldn&#8217;t think of which block was my favorite. While I was sitting there on that stage,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that one of my favorite things about WordPress’s 6.0 release, like Matt, wasn&#8217;t really a block, but it was a functional workflow sort of thing. So my favorite thing was the ability to lock blocks, but I mean, the question was about favorite blocks. And so I do know that some of the most anticipated blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks. Whew. What a sentence!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:46]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to say that three times fast! Those blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks, they are sort of shortcuts that show up when you&#8217;re selecting multiple blocks and allow for easy side-by-side layouts. I&#8217;m not explaining it in a way that does it much justice, but I will share a link in the show notes that has more information and you can kind of see how empowering that particular block is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question I wanted to give a little more context to came from Courtney Robertson. She asked about how to make translated content more readily available on learn.wordpress.org. My answer was pretty far ranging and talked about why it&#8217;s harder to commit to prioritizing that over, for my example, translating WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also understand that there are people who want to help and just need someone to point them in the right direction. And so I want to be clear that it is possible to have workshops in any language on learn.wordpress.org right now. We just don&#8217;t have a lot of people contributing those translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are conversations going on right now in the training team about using Glotpress on learn.wordpress.org, and also how to translate subtitles. So, if you are looking for ways to give back through translation and training is an important kind of area of your focus. I will have links to both of those things in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:11]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave a quick answer, uh, after this question about how hard it is to recognize contributions that are separate from a major event or major release. In this case, when I say recognize, that&#8217;s recognized as in thank, not recognize as in, know it exists. In case it&#8217;s not clear why that was connected, why that answer was connected to the question, training materials are self-serve and not always specific to individual releases of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that means the maintenance of any content around training happens routinely over the course of time, rather than because of a specific release or a WordCamp. What sometimes can make it a little harder to entice people to join us in that work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the third question I&#8217;d like to tackle is the one that came from Megan Rose. She asked how we can encourage better diversity as we go back to in-person events. My answer was more about the big picture, program-wide work that has been done and specific awarenesses that I, as a leader, have been keeping top of mind. That answer is still true and is still important, but again, it doesn&#8217;t really help anyone who&#8217;s wondering how they can show up today in their own communities, and do the hard work of fostering an inclusive space there so that we can confidently welcome more diverse voices together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great place to start is to have conversations with people who aren&#8217;t like you and really listen. Also recognizing that we all come from different backgrounds that give us more or less opportunity and always be asking yourself, who is missing from this conversation and why, how can I find them and invite them into our own WordPress spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that all kind of feels right up your alley, I would check out the show notes. I&#8217;ll have some links in there to the community team’s site, as well as a few posts that will help you to explore that a bit further as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also a couple of questions about market share slash usage of WordPress, and Five for the Future that I really do want to answer, but as I was writing up the context and just kind of exploring the questions that people were raising, it turned out to really be quite a big set of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will do those in either two separate episodes of their own or one surprisingly long, for me, episode. And so there you have it, a lightning round, deep dive on a few questions from WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Jonathan Desrosiers </strong>00:06:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great to be back in person. Um, it&#8217;s been a long two years, two or three years for a lot of people and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great that we&#8217;re such an asynchronous community and we can all stay connected online through Slack and different means. Um, but there are some things that you can&#8217;t replace, like making friends with people and learning people&#8217;s demeanors and having some discussions in person that you can&#8217;t replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, uh, I&#8217;m really excited to see people I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. Meet new people and, um, you know, have some of those discussions here today in Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:07:21]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which then brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed the announcement, WordCamp Europe will be in Athens next year. And the call for organizers is open already. It&#8217;s an experience that is absolutely irreplaceable. So I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, in case you&#8217;ve always wanted to give back to WordPress that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that work on the next major release of WordPress is already underway. There is a post with roadmap info that was published recently, as well as a slightly more casual thread on Twitter. I&#8217;ve linked both of those in the show notes, so that you have some concept of what it is that we are aiming for in 6.1, and also a concept of where to go to get started working on it if that&#8217;s what you feel like doing, uh, for the next three to four months– 120 days, roughly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and finally. This is less of like a thing to be aware of in the next two weeks and kind of a little WordPress project tool tip. Did you know that we have a calendar that shows all meetings for all teams all week long? It will make you feel tired by the amount of work that gets done in the WordPress project every week, but it&#8217;s right there on make.wordpress.org/meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you never have to wonder where folks are meeting to talk about things ever again. And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Santana Inniss &amp; Héctor Prieto </strong>00:09:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello!

She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp" class="wp-image-12961" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="329" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors" class="wp-image-12957" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones.

It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it. As well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help.

Explore more ways to streamline your content creation process, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Select text across multiple blocks for easier copying and pasting.</li><li>Type two open brackets `<code>[[</code>` to quickly access a list of recent posts and pages.</li><li>Keep existing styles when you transform some blocks from one kind to another—from a Paragraph block to a Code block, for instance.</li><li>Create customized buttons and any new buttons you make will retain the style customizations automatically.</li><li>Make tag clouds and social icons even more appealing with updated settings and controls, and a new outline style for the tag cloud.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1204" height="700" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Style-switcher-big.gif?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1" alt="Style variations of Twenty Twenty Two theme" class="wp-image-12893" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style Switching&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes now include the option to contain multiple style variations. This expands the new Style system even further and enables shortcuts to switch the look and feel of your site all within a single theme. In block themes that support this feature, you can change both the available settings, like the font-weight, and the style options, like the default color palette. Change the look and feel of your site with just a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1204" height="700" src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1" alt="Popover listing available templates" class="wp-image-12889" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Template Choices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 includes five new template options for block themes: author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy. These additional templates provide greater flexibility for content creators. Tailor each with the tools you already know or with the following new options in this release:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Featured images can be used in the cover block.</li><li>New featured image sizing controls make it easier to get the results you want.</li><li>While editing a template, at the root, or between blocks, the quick inserter shows you patterns and template parts to help you work faster and discover new layout options.</li><li>The query block supports filtering on multiple authors, support for custom taxonomies, and support for customizing what is shown when there are no results.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1204" height="700" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1" alt="Browsing footer patterns in the quick inserter" class="wp-image-12890" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Integrated Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns will now appear when you need them in even more places, like in the quick inserter or when creating a new header or footer. If you’re a block theme author, you can even <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/">register patterns from the Pattern Directory using `<code>theme.json</code>`</a>, enabling you to prioritize specific patterns that are most helpful to your theme’s users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Design Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Design tools grow more powerful and intuitive with each release. Some highlights for 6.0 include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A new color panel design saves space, but still shows your options at a glance.&nbsp;</li><li>New border controls offer a simpler way to set your border exactly as you like it.&nbsp;</li><li>Transparency levels for your colors allow for even more creative color options.</li><li>Control gaps, margins, typography, and more on a collection of blocks, all at once, in the Group block.</li><li>Switch between stack, row, and group variations to position groups of blocks with more layout flexibility.</li><li>Use the gap support functionality in the Gallery block to create different looks – from adding spacing between all images, to removing spacing altogether.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1204" height="700" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1" alt="Selecting multiple blocks in the list view" class="wp-image-12891" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New keyboard shortcuts enable you to select multiple blocks from the list view, modify them in bulk, and drag and drop them within the list. List View can be opened and closed easily; it comes collapsed by default and it automatically expands to the current selection whenever you select a block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1204" height="700" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1" alt="Unlocking the block in the block toolbar" class="wp-image-12892" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Locking Controls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can lock your blocks. Choose to disable the option to move a block, remove a block, or both. This simplifies project handover, allowing your clients to unleash their creativity without worrying about accidentally breaking their site in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Performance in WordPress 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes several updates focused on improving the performance of WordPress.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y&#8217;all, we&#8217;ve got an absolutely jam-packed couple of weeks in WordPress. We&#8217;ve got events happening and releases shipping and contributor days being coordinated (I almost said contributor days being contributed). That&#8217;s also what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ll share some of those highlights in today&#8217;s small list of big things, but I did want to specifically call out something that&#8217;s coming up this week on Thursday (May 19, 2022), and that something is Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team of contributors over on the Accessibility team has participated in the Global Accessibility Awareness Day in the past. So I thought it would be interesting to hear from one of the co-founders of this particular day of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. And with that, Joe Devin, would you like to tell us a little bit more about yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:01:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So I am the co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is a day that goes viral every year on the third Thursday of May. We typically have the Twitter reach on the GAAD hashtag on Twitter of 200 million users, which is, I think, pretty much their active user count. We stopped counting once we hit their daily active user count. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I am Chair of the GAAD Foundation, which we launched last year. And then I have a day job too, where I&#8217;m CEO and co-founder of Diamond, which is an inclusive digital agency that builds software accessibly by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:15]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Well, we are so excited to have you today. I said we like it&#8217;s me and the mouse in my pocket—we in the WordPress community that&#8217;s going to listen to this. Super excited to have you today. So you mentioned GAAD, Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Last year was your 10th anniversary, which is very exciting, but like with so many good things, I hear it all started with a blog post and a blog post on WordPress, no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d love to hear about how GAAD evolved from that, with, as I understand it, your co-founder of Jennison (Asuncion). That must be where you met him, I assume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:02:51] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yes. So what happened was I started a WordPress blog called <em>My SQL Talk</em>. So it&#8217;s a database blog, and I just thought it was a brilliant name. I mean, My SQL Talk, like that, should be super popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it probably had maybe ten people who ever looked. Um, and then my dad was getting older, and my dad was a survivor of the concentration camps, and he was a genius. He spoke ten languages. It, he was one of those people. That, when he walked into a room, he just commanded respect. You knew that there was history. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it really, but it was special when my dad walked into the room. And considering all of this that he suffered in his life, watching him get older and struggle, particularly with his banking, was very painful to see. And the bank wasn&#8217;t accessible, so I wrote this blog post proposing that we create a Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I get these visions, and they never turn into anything. But while I think about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s write this blog post and this can definitely work. Right?&#8221; And then you finish the blog post to hit send, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;this is not going to work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t even smart enough to do social media on it. But fortunately, WordPress had an auto-tweet feature, and it tweeted it out, and Jennison Asuncion, my co-founder, happened to be around and not out that Saturday night. And he read the blog post, and he said, &#8220;this is a great idea. Let&#8217;s make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had two busy people, but we both had a community. He had the accessibility community, and I was building a tech scene in Los Angeles. And what I discovered is if you combine a great idea with the community, great things can happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:49]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, you&#8217;re speaking my language over here, helping people find their communities, knowing that community is the thing that is the lifeblood of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounded like a tautology. It is not a tautology. You can have a society with an attempt to not have any sort of community around it, but I bet it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very interesting. And so you all just kind of talked through what that would look like, I assume in confidence, or that would have to take place, right? Or was it on Twitter in those days?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:05:24]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you could still look in the comments and see the back and forth of Jennison and a bunch of other people that got pretty involved with GAAD that are some legendary folks in there. It&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because I dunno how, how you feel, but for me, when I used to code, uh, three months later, I&#8217;d look back at old code and be like, &#8220;oh, I suck,&#8221; you know, or write an email even and you look back on it a day later and are like &#8220;what a stupid email, how stupid am I?&#8221; You know?  But I look back on that one after ten years; I was scared to look at it because I&#8217;m like, it must&#8217;ve been really bad. But you know, it kind of held up, and exactly what I wrote in there happened &#8211; to my utter shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it&#8217;s kinda nice, though, to look back and be like, &#8220;oh, I used to be much dumber.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause then you&#8217;re like, look how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m no longer that dumb. I&#8217;m a different kind of dumb now; good for me. I always hope to be a different kind of dumb as I go forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, okay, so that was your ten-year anniversary last year. GAAD, in general, now has been going on for 11 years, and at the time of this recording, in a couple of weeks, but then probably a week when it finally publishes, you have your next, your next round of that going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it seems safe to assume that awareness of the need for accessibility has increased during that time, but we all know that the work of accessibility is ongoing. And so, I&#8217;m just curious to hear from your perspective if the awareness of the need for accessibility has generally started to permeate developer communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And are you seeing more developer awareness around the need for accessibility in tech in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:07:12]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You know, it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s certainly improved a lot.  I keynoted a conference probably four years after GAAD started, maybe five, and I kind of assumed nobody would have heard of accessibility, and I was taken aback when I asked who had heard of it, and a good chunk of the room had. So even then, there had been a difference, and I&#8217;d say now I see accessibility mentioned a lot more in conferences and stuff. But when it comes to actually building it, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of ignorance. There, there still needs to be a lot more awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think partially people are a little bit scared to dip their toe because they&#8217;re scared that they&#8217;re going to be told that &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; or that they&#8217;re going to say the wrong word or offend somebody. So I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s some degree of trepidation, but also developers, and it&#8217;s not just developers, designers, and product people. There&#8217;s so much to learn, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh God, there&#8217;s another piece that I have to learn.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so glad that you invited me on this podcast because it&#8217;s the developers that, you know, I am a developer, not anymore, I haven&#8217;t touched code in years, but that&#8217;s where I came from. Right? This is my peach, right? Particularly WordPress folks, because I had done a fair bit of WordPress before I moved on to some other things. And, I think we have to talk about usability and understand that accessibility is so much more than how we look at disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. How do you think the typical WordPress developer or designer would define disability? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the kinds of conversations that I&#8217;ve had over the years, it frequently has to do with visual things. Because it&#8217;s just screens all day, right? And that&#8217;s a primary area where our designers and developers really have made some effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my personal favorite sort of, of example, for like, when you&#8217;re looking at how to make sure that your products are accessible is, what, if you have to use your website, or you have to build your website using only one arm. Because that gives you an opportunity to kind of look at disability from a permanent standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you have lost permanent use of one arm, but also gives you an opportunity to look at the temporary options for that sort of lack of mobility. Like you&#8217;re a mother with an infant, and so you have to be able to, you know, get your stuff done with one arm. And so I know that we paid a bunch of attention to screen readers and what works in not way back in 2018 and 2019 did a lot of work with. Literally zero screen. And can you still do the thing that you need to do, which was incredibly difficult. And I was really excited to see what our developers came up with around that. But I think that that is quite a bit of that discussion as we&#8217;re going through it from the beginning to the&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a great answer, and you definitely understand some of the nuances way better than I think that the average creator, digital product creator, I&#8217;m including the, you know, the product people, the designers, and the developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re very fortunate to have more than just developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:50]  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that the WHO (World Health Organization) had to; they&#8217;re the ones that did massive research across the globe. And they had to, they had to come up with a definition, and in their definition, they needed to draw a line. Typically, I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing cause it&#8217;s a 350-page report, and I kept looking for where they defined it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little hard to find, but essentially it&#8217;s if there&#8217;s a major disability or a disability that impacts some significant portion of your day-to-day activities. And that&#8217;s really great when you&#8217;re trying to do a report on how many disabilities there are out there; what percentage of the population has a disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their figures are something like 15% of the population has a disability, which is a huge number. But at the same time, they also mentioned that 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment. And we also know that over 33% of the population is over 50, and I&#8217;m included in that population. And I can say that when you&#8217;re over 50, you know, I&#8217;ve got clouds in my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where they came from, but they definitely make it harder to see. When I&#8217;m in a restaurant, I can&#8217;t focus on the person across from me the same way. My hearing is not the same, and anybody over 50 is going to have certain impairments and won&#8217;t see as well; color contrast issues are a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to raise the font is a big deal. And I think that accessibility is connected in most people&#8217;s minds with disability. And they&#8217;ll attach that to something like being blind or being deaf or hard of hearing or having a missing limb or having some other kind of disability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t even know any people in that category possibly,&#8221; and as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, how important is this?&#8221; Yes. They might feel guilty. I should do the right thing. This is the right thing to do. But honestly, like how much money should I spend on it? How much, what percentage of my time should I spend on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize that everybody has different abilities. And so, I&#8217;m starting to go away from even talking about disabilities and asking people to remember that all of us perceive things differently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the gold dress where they were trying to say, what color is this dress? Is it gold and white or blue and black? And it is blue and black, but to me, all I see is gold and white. And then there was Laurel or Yanny. Do you remember that?. And some people heard it, and typically older people heard it as Laurel, and I&#8217;ve, and I do this in some of my presentations. I play that, that sound. And usually, it&#8217;s Laurel for me, but sometimes it&#8217;s Yanny. Even personally, it changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we have a totally different perception. Now think about memory. There&#8217;s a different kind of blindness. If you try and remember, let&#8217;s say a relative or a friend that is no longer. How well do you see that picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for me, it is very, very vague, but for some people, they say, and I&#8217;ve been asking people, and I&#8217;d love your answer as well. How vivid is it? And some people say, I can read the, I can see the pattern on the shirt. It&#8217;s as vivid as if I see with opening my eyes, seeing, you know, the regular in front of me, and I can even read a name tag in the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, Woah, so maybe I&#8217;m blind in a way. Right? So how do you see it? How do you remember things?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a real visual person and a tactile person. And so, like if I interacted with someone, I&#8217;m very likely to be able to picture, like, recreate that mental picture pretty well in my mind. I recently, very recently, met some of my first people in that executive leadership space who were like, yeah, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t visualize things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, what are you, how do you do this work? Because like, you have to be able to do that. And they were like, no, I don&#8217;t have mental pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t have an inner dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand that either,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:19] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either. So accessibility studies all of these differences with respect to how you&#8217;re presenting all of this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t pay attention to accessibility, you&#8217;re really just missing out. And then there&#8217;s colorblindness. If you&#8217;re creating something like slack that has an online/offline indicator, and you only use red and green for people who are colorblind, they see gray and gray. And so what I&#8217;m trying to teach the community with digital product creators is that no, you cannot ignore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ignore accessibility, but then you&#8217;re not good at your job. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to say it in an offensive way, but you&#8217;re not good at your job if you&#8217;re unaware. If you break a rule on purpose, great. But if you don&#8217;t know the rule, it&#8217;s just a lack of craft, and you absolutely should make it a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it as a charity. You&#8217;re doing it because you care about your users, and you care about your craft, and you want to build things well, and it&#8217;s a necessity. And I think that this is the kind of message that our community needs to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:31]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to touch on something that you sort of brought up a bit, um, at the start of the answer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you brought up the concept of usability. And in the last time that I did a podcast about accessibility, I defined accessibility as a subset of usability. Do you think that if we were to consistently draw that line for people so that it&#8217;s not just like accessibility is this thing that you should do outside of usability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to more consistently draw that line, do you think that that would help people to see and understand better that its shades of existence, usability, and accessibility?  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:17:10] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, 100%, a hundred percent. And in my company, we kind of realized that that&#8217;s exactly what we have to do. We have to see this as usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t, we talk about accessibility a lot, but I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s part of the plumbing for us. We&#8217;ve made it part of the plumbing, and I can tell you it&#8217;s a struggle to take accessibility and make it part of an organization, even when you&#8217;re bringing it top-down, believe it or not. For our teams, particularly the designers, they are blown away by what they&#8217;re learning because they&#8217;re improving their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And design is typically where there&#8217;s a struggle to get accessibility accepted because there seems to be a very strong idea of what a design should look like. And I think it&#8217;s really about the approach because UX and design it&#8217;s all about empathy for people. And when you approach it, not as, even though empathy should mean that, that, you know, do the right thing at the same time, it&#8217;s more about empathy for your user, and your user includes so much more than just people with disabilities that you haven&#8217;t run into somebody that has that disability and therefore you build it better, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s completely blown their mind. They love it. They love doing it. And I&#8217;m not hiring people with accessibility coming in. We&#8217;re training them to work accessibly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s interesting that you talk about empathy as part of being able to make sure that you&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s accessible because I actually feel like empathy is. Like it&#8217;s being considered this gold standard for many, many things right now. And I think it actually is more harmful in the long run than instead making altruistic choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have a blog post that I will link in our show notes that will kind of help everybody see more fully my concept there. But when you rely on empathy, you do kind of have to rely on one, being able to run into all of the issues you were mentioning. You have to know people who have problems in order to know that the problems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also kind of have to assume that once you have willingly put yourself into the discomfort of that kind of disability, whatever, wherever it exists on that spectrum, your experience of that discomfort is the same as someone who lives with it. And I just don&#8217;t think that we can necessarily do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think that trying to do the altruistic thing, like doing your research and figuring out what it is and trying to make decisions on behalf of other people as best you can, which is a terrible thing. Still, like decisions that take into account the experiences that people are sharing with you and then going to them and saying, &#8220;does this make that experience better or worse?&#8221; is the more sustainable option from my perspective, this is specifically leadership. Still, I think it&#8217;s true for accessibility as well, and probably product design as a whole, but it&#8217;s very difficult. Like people really feel like they understand the concept of empathy right now. And I do think that sometimes that leads us down the wrong path for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your thought on that? I think you kind of agree based on what your answer was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:20:33]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, absolutely. And you know, we, you, can&#8217;t never about us without us, as the common saying, and we&#8217;ve gathered a group of a hundred people with a wide variety of disabilities for research. Whenever we do any UX and research, and sometimes we&#8217;re asked to just do research projects, we go out and ask the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some really interesting companies approach us to do innovation and accessibility, and they had strong assumptions. We looked at the assumptions and agreed with it, but we&#8217;re like, all right, they were smart. They said, &#8220;vet this with users for us, please,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t want to gather their own group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We vetted with users, and we&#8217;re blown away, always blown away because there are so many things you just don&#8217;t know unless you&#8217;ve lived with a particular disability. You can&#8217;t guess, and you&#8217;ve got to speak to your users and a wide variety of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. What role does open source play in expanding accessibility, either in specifically the digital space or just accessibility in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:21:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if the question is, what role does it play? I would say the role it plays is it is, unfortunately, it makes accessibility worse because, for the most part open source is not very accessible. And it&#8217;s a personal passion of mine, so I&#8217;m really glad that you brought that up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is so bizarre. You write a blog post and then it goes viral, and it goes viral every year to a degree that you can&#8217;t even believe it, that all these companies that you know are running events. Privately, publicly talking about it. And then you get all these people thanking you for what you&#8217;ve done year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one year, you read on Twitter, The Blind Onion; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with The Onion, the satirical clip, there&#8217;s the Blind Onion. And they tweet out, &#8220;Now that Global Accessibility Awareness Day is over, we look forward to 364 days of global accessibility oblivion.&#8221; And that really hurt at the time, but at the same time, and I was told to ignore it, don&#8217;t worry about it, but I&#8217;m like, no, this is coming from a place of pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point of GAAD was to make a difference. It wasn&#8217;t too to just give everybody an opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, look at what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; and then not make a difference. So, as a result of that, I started to think about, well, where are we with this? And, and so I&#8217;ve created a state of accessibility report that through my company, we&#8217;re able to run for a few years, and it&#8217;s not, you know, the state is not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, well, what can we do to change things? So, as a result of all of this, I really wanted to figure out, well, what can we do to make sure that GAAD does make a difference? And so, I came up with the idea of the GAAD pledge, which is specifically meant for open source frameworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea of the GAAD pledge is that an open source framework, when they are ready, takes the pledge to make accessibility a core value of the framework. Now, terms of what that actually entails are different for every single project because every project is unique. We did create a bit of a framework, which had the idea of saying, okay, you&#8217;re going to, first of all, create an accessibility statement that says that this framework is going to conform to whatever, WCAG, which is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to whatever WCAG level is decided and is appropriate for the framework. That there&#8217;s going to be documentation for anybody that is downloading this piece of open source project and trying to implement it, that there should be guidelines for them, that all of the examples should be accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really important because even the frameworks that try to pay attention to accessibility. You&#8217;ll often see that people from the community will provide examples, and they&#8217;re inaccessible. And it&#8217;s really sad when you see that because so many people are just copy-pasting. That&#8217;s typically how it works, and they&#8217;re going to copy-paste something bad. So putting a statement around it, I think, would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re hoping to see is that lots and lots of big open source communities decide to take the pledge. And then it&#8217;ll sort of be table stakes that any new open source projects as well look, all of these frameworks that made it, they took the pledge and therefore we should take the pledge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the very first year, we had React Native take the pledge, and they put a lot of effort into their accessibility. The second group to take it was Ember.js, and they always put a lot of effort into their accessibility, and they continued that effort. We&#8217;re about to announce the next one, but we&#8217;re still two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can&#8217;t say anything yet, but yeah, we&#8217;re, uh, we&#8217;re hoping for a lot more uptake on, on the gap pledge because it, it affects so many people downstream. WordPress&#8217;s what percent of the web right now? 43%? So there you go. That&#8217;s so many people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:25:57] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people. Yeah, fun fact Gutenberg, our current rewriting of the editing experience in WordPress, primarily uses React. And so, I&#8217;m glad to hear that they have taken that pledge as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any good cooking, it starts with good&nbsp;ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:12] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it. That was great. I wish I was a cook, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:23] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. All right. Let&#8217;s what keeps you up at night when it comes to the state of accessibility?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:29] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me up at night is how to move the needle. It is such a big thing to change. And there are so many angles that you can approach this with, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a monster. There are so many legacy sites out there. If you look at WebAIM, they do a yearly report on the state of accessibility as well. They call it the WebAIM Million, and they&#8217;re typically seeing 97% inaccessible, 98%. It goes up and down a little bit every year. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just a huge boat to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we need to at least get the newer, uh, newer websites and mobile apps to move. And what we&#8217;ve seen in our state of accessibility report is that only the very top companies seem to put in the effort to make their products accessible. There is a big push with the enterprise companies to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEOs are starting to talk about it, but what we need is the entire culture of software development to change. Or I should even say digital product development change and to move that boat is massive. And that&#8217;s I put it in my tagline in my email like that&#8217;s my mission in life, and I hope to achieve it before I die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that keeps me up at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:52] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would keep me up at night as well. I mean, it seems like you are really just personally mission-driven and impact-driven. Do you feel like, in the event that the work that you&#8217;ve accomplished so far is what you accomplish, you feel still like you&#8217;ve had an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you have had&nbsp;an impact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people that tries to have a legacy or like tries to focus on what my impact is and all of that. I just try and do good work. And hopefully, it just shows at the end of the day. I&#8217;m just trying to have the impact without the accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. Well, Joe, thank you so much for joining us here on this episode of WP Briefing. You have been a delight to chat with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure to meet you, and uh, and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:54] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. As I mentioned at the start, it is packed. Number one tomorrow, May 17th, RC3. So one of the final RCs that we&#8217;re going to have for the WordPress 6.0 release, unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, which I don&#8217;t think it will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, two days after that, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, as I mentioned, will be on May 19th. So, this coming Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then next week, we have the 6.0 release. We have the WordPress 6.0 release on May 24th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Three days after that, WordPress turns 19 on May 27th, starting its final teenage year before we turn twenty in 2023. So that was the rapid-fire dance card for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff that is happening with and around WordPress for everyone to know. As a heads up, also, many people are headed to WordCamp Europe in Porto(, Portugal). The first week of June, I am going to do a live from WordCamp Europe episode. It will not be live. I&#8217;ll just record it live. And so. You know you&#8217;ll get to hear me with my hoarsest voice and maybe singing to my computer. Cause that almost always happens at these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"12855";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:69:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 (RC2) Now Available for Testing";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/wordpress-6-0-release-candidate-2-rc2-now-available-for-testing/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 10 May 2022 18:06:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"6.0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12840";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:171:"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 is now available for testing!

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s a big day. It marks the beginning of what is called the RC period, or release candidate period, for the current major release of the WordPress CMS. If you&#8217;re not super familiar with the way release cycles work, this is the point in the process where the code should pretty much be done changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you can call in your designers, developers, and anyone else who builds things for others using your software. And they can either start testing their products on it, or they can figure out what new things they need to be able to teach their clients, whichever is most relevant to them. That is generally true for WordPress as well, but in true open source fashion, there is a caveat built in that helps us to get in last-minute, vital changes from contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a two-person sign-off rule that&#8217;s been around for about as long as I can remember, but lets things be added late in the release cycle, as long as there are two sign-offs from qualified contributors. Most of the time, those qualified contributors are lead developers of the project, but not always. We have a good group of people who are around helping us make sure that this is doable and the best thing that we can offer to all of our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, two-person sign-off, that is the little bit of release process trivia that you never knew you needed. And since we&#8217;re looking at a release trivia, kind of hidden bits of how software is made, I actually have a guest with me today, Channing Ritter. So Channing is a product and visual designer based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s a design director at Automattic and has been working on the WordPress project as a full-time sponsored contributor since January, 2021. She is joining us to share some behind the scenes intel on what&#8217;s going into the 6.0 release, her role in that process, and then we&#8217;ll just kind of see how the conversation goes from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and with that, I&#8217;d like to welcome Channing to the WordPress Briefing. Hi Channing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter </strong>00:02:45]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey Josepha. Thanks so much for having me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:02:48] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to have you here. If I understand, you are working on the design side of things with the release. So why don&#8217;t you tell me a little bit about the role you&#8217;ve played?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:02:59] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am. I am the design release lead for the 6.0 release. And if I understand correctly, this is a position that has been unfulfilled for the past few release cycles. So I&#8217;m kind of the first person to step in over the past few releases. And I think that&#8217;s really exciting, especially because design has started to play such a more important role in the WordPress project over the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it makes sense that design would have a seat at the table, and I&#8217;m really excited to be helping advocate for the design team and learning from other folks on the release squad. Who&#8217;ve been doing this for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:03:33] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. First big question about 6.0, what is the feature that you are most excited about?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:03:39] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m most excited about the style switcher within the global styles panel. Um, so if folks still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about there, it&#8217;s the ability to change between different variations of the theme.json without actually switching the theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a way to get a drastically different look and feels across your site with just a single click. And I see it as a really fun place to experiment and kind of get inspired for the different ways your site could appear without ever having to change your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in terms of the Twenty Twenty-Two variations, they&#8217;re just really gorgeous and all so diverse. Like you have the main default theme that has the deep green and kind of peachy colors and this really elegant type treatment with a really thin Serif typeface. But then the variations are so different from that. And I think my favorite one is the Swiss variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:36]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss variation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, every graphic design nerd loves Swiss design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:42] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, ok! Now I know!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really awesome things found in there. It&#8217;s a really high contrast, bold variation. It&#8217;s kind of black and white with red accents. I just love how different it is from the default style and how easy it is to change up your site and just get a whole drastically different look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:00] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. So for folks who do not know what we&#8217;re referring to, when we talk about the Twenty Twenty-Two variation, that is the default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. I&#8217;ll put a link to both the classic and block-based versions in our show notes, but you&#8217;ll want to use the block-based version to look at these style variations that Channing has mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:05:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re really excited that the first-ever default block theme was released with 5.9, which is when Twenty Twenty-Two first went out and was bundled with 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, with 6.0, I think even more so it&#8217;s starting to showcase the real power of block themes and what can actually be done there. And style variations is a huge kind of first step into this new world of block themes and starting to really open up the possibilities and all the flexibility that you have there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:55] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. So when we&#8217;re talking about the Twenty Twenty-Two default theme, when we&#8217;re talking about switching these variations inside the theme itself, that seems to me to be a very user-focused kind of feature. And when we talk about users in WordPress, there&#8217;s a lot of room for interpretation. Like if we look at it kind of in a framework of three types of users of WordPress, you have, like end-users. So people who are site owners using it as a site to, like, enable their business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you also have mid-end users—people who use it to build sites for others. And what I like to call back-end users, people who are using WordPress as a framework. And of course at the start of the Gutenberg project, way back in forever, a million years ago, one of the big calls to action that we had around even, like, trying to do this, was that we wanted to make WordPress easier for users. Just plain users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and to me, that means making WordPress easier for those mid-end users, people who are creating WordPress sites for other people. But also should give some power and autonomy back to those end-users, the people who are using sites to enable their business or are site owners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:07:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in that context, between 5.9 and 6.0, do you feel like we have features that are really giving that kind of power and agency back to our end-users? Do you feel like we have some features that are really focused on those mid-end users, as opposed to our backend users? For a long time, we focused heavily on enabling our backend users, and now Gutenberg kind of moves us into those other two areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so do you think that things like being able to switch between your style of variations, other things like that are moving us closer to that particular goal of Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:07:51] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. I think it&#8217;s both. I think some of the features being released in 6.0 are absolutely going to empower that end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly in terms of improvements around design tools and some of the quality of life improvements. For example, partially selecting across multiple blocks and being able to partially select texts there. That&#8217;s the type of thing that really brings the writing experience in the editor to be on par with how you would expect a text editing experience to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are tons of small quality of life improvements in this release that I think are really gonna help those end-users. But there are also improvements around what we might call the maintainers who are building sites for others. I think block locking in particular is something that is really going to start filling a gap between people who build the sites and then people who do the day-to-day maintenance within a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 6.0, we&#8217;re introducing some interface UI around block locking, but also there&#8217;ll be control around the ability to lock user roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:09:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think makes a lot of sense. I mean, we have all of these user roles in the CMS itself, and for a long time, we&#8217;ve just been like free for all on blocks, which was great and is great and should be available to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also if we are saying, like, it makes sense to have this gradient of users and their abilities for the CMS itself, and we are saying that we want to move control of the website and the content to be at the base layer in these blocks, then it also makes sense that we should be able to provide that same sort of granular level of access in the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s a great thing. If you all, if dear listeners, you do not know what we mean by “block locking,” I&#8217;m sure that I can find a link for us in our show notes below as well. If for anyone who&#8217;s been talking through Gutenberg things with me for a while, you know that this is one of the primary use cases that I think has been a long time coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:10:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was one of the first examples that I offered to folks when we had that question of like, who is this being built for? In what way is this beneficial to that mid-end user, as opposed to just giving all of the power and autonomy to users in a way that maybe is not the best for their visitors?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those use cases that made the most sense to me being able to say, okay, well, the opportunity to, as somebody who runs an agency and is building websites for people to be able to say, yeah, ‘You can do anything that is possible in this instance of WordPress and all the things that you are allowed to do will not break your instance. It won&#8217;t break your website’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it gives a lot of time back to agencies to focus on their client&#8217;s most important problems, as opposed to not knowing how to update the hours in their footer or something like that. And so I&#8217;m very excited about that particular feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:11:01]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s such a long-requested feature. I mean, we&#8217;ve been hearing requests around this particular feature for years and, you know, often when something gets requested over a span of years like that, it&#8217;s because there are some complexities to figure out how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s definitely been the case with moving forward with block locking. And there are a lot of nuances there. But I think what you were saying, I totally agree with. There’s always a push and pull. And as we enable more and more flexibility for end-users, there needs to be a little bit of push from the other side to kind of give more granular controls, more locking options, and make sure that everything can still be easily maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:11:43]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we mentioned in that answer the concept of maintainers. If you are a contributor, it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> kind of ‘maintainer.’ So if you&#8217;re a WordPress contributor and we said maintainers there, um, just know that that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re referring to. If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about when I say ‘contributor,’ there is a whole community of open source people and maintainers are people who specifically take care of a particular part of the WordPress software or the WordPress project, um, that makes all this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, ya know….&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:12:19] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So true! The maintainer has another meaning in this context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:12:20]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we have a mix in our audience and I love it, but it also makes me frequently spend like 10% of my podcast being like, by the way, when I said this, I didn&#8217;t mean you, but I did mean <em>you</em>, which makes it harder. I know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. You’ve been with the project for a little bit, but if I recall correctly, this is the first time that you were, like, leading part of a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what would you say was the most challenging part of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:12:52] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great question. This is my first time being this closely involved with the release. Although I was involved with the 5.9 release, but mostly in a release assets capacity. So I helped with the <em>About Page</em> and the welcome banner that goes on the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did get some insight in the last release cycle. Which was great preparation for being more involved as a release lead on this cycle. From the design perspective, one of the hardest things is always going to be figuring out what exactly goes into the release and what needs more time. In the sense, you know, that there might be some features that need to stay in the Gutenberg plugin for a while and get more testing before they get released to a much wider audience in a major WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think on the design side, we definitely have some goals that are big, long-term projects that are likely going to span across, you know, many releases, maybe even over many years. And I think the full site editor is a great example of that in a sense that it&#8217;s not something that you just were gone in one release and then it all gets released and then it&#8217;s all good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:14:06] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s something that has to be staggered across many releases, and there&#8217;s a lot of thought that goes into it; does this make sense in this more limited capacity, and what else needs to go in in order for this feature to go in? And the most complex things about the WordPress project is how interconnected things are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you start making those decisions about what should go in, what should get pulled out, often there&#8217;s sort of a domino effect of like, well, that would affect this feature and then, well, maybe they shouldn&#8217;t go in, or maybe this does need to go in. And that is really one of the most challenging, but also one of the most fascinating aspects of the release process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:14:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. It is very, very true that there are kind of no small problems left in WordPress. *laughs* Yeah, when we, when we first started with this like bigger release squad, cause that has not been routine for the history of the project. When we first started with that, I know that expanding out the exposure to like how much one change affects 25 different things was really, it was really good for all of us to be reminded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I mentioned at the top of our episode today, tomorrow begins the RC period. It begins the release candidate period, which is when it&#8217;s supposed to be, as locked down as possible. But if you all have been following along with our release process in general, which if you&#8217;re listening to this, you probably have, you know that last week or a couple of weeks ago, we had this whole question about the Webfonts API, and we had that conversation in a public space as best we could,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, there are always things that you can&#8217;t, like, fully disclose in public spaces, but we had a very open and transparent conversation about, like, who is most affected by putting it in, in the state that the API was in. And, who&#8217;s most affected if we take it out. And where can we make compromises on either side so that both sides are a little happy and a little unhappy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:16:09] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, like, that is all so hard to do. Not only in general. We have a 20-year-old code base and a five-year-old code base. And it&#8217;s all a big, big undertaking to understand what is happening and where it happens. And so there&#8217;s this moment always when we are trying to decide, like, is this baked enough? Did we put it in too early? Should we pull it out? How, if we pull it out, did we ask people to do too much work before we decided to pull it out anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you always have those kinds of questions about it. And honestly, I think that most of us weren&#8217;t around the last time, that WordPress was, was this experimental in public, like it&#8217;s always been open source. It&#8217;s always been experimental and iterating publicly, which is just the hardest way to work on anything. We like, we shipped our best guesses. Don&#8217;t be mad. It&#8217;ll be… we&#8217;re coming for it. We&#8217;re going to fix it. Like, that&#8217;s always hard, but the last time around, when it was this substantial a change was, like, 2008 or something, like, it was ages and ages ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:17:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were smaller than, we had a smaller number of contributors. We had a smaller group of people actually using the CMS. And so over time it has gotten more and more complicated. And, and I don&#8217;t think that we can ever understate the complexities of that. And so for you, you had a little bit of exposure to it in 5.9 and then showed up for like really doing it in 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has it been a surprising change? Like, were you surprised much more by how complicated it was when you were closer to it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:17:47] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, definitely. It’s been a real learning process, especially coming to understand how much there really are no easy answers. I think a lot of us are in the release squad are real problem solver types of people and, and want it to, you know, be a really neat, tidy answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not always the case. You know, sometimes parts of the feature might go in, or some contingency plan might get put into place and things didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. But what you said of being an experiment and being on kind of the cutting edge of trying out new things, I think there is a lot of passion around that in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, we&#8217;re in such a transitional period for the project, you know, moving from classic themes to block themes and really changing the ideas of how we approach designing sites. And because of that, I think there is a lot of momentum and energy around getting new features, as many new features as possible into each release. But there&#8217;s also, you know, a lot of testing and stuff that needs to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to make sure that, like you said, these things aren&#8217;t going out too early.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:19:01] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and there&#8217;s always that difficulty, we&#8217;re going to just leap right into open source areas now. There&#8217;s always that difficulty around, like, there&#8217;s this concept that when, like, we always want to ship something that doesn&#8217;t break backward compatibility when possible, we don&#8217;t want to ship vulnerabilities. Like, that&#8217;s always true, but we are in an open source project, and open source projects are necessarily kind of tolerant of like, that&#8217;s not our best, but like it skates, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was, we aimed for Ferrari and got a skateboard because sometimes you got to start with a skateboard, right? *laughter* Like if it gets you from one place to another, that&#8217;s kind of where we&#8217;ve got to aim some days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:19:45] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:19:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s always so, so difficult, especially cause, like, for the big change that 5.0 represented, and that 5.9 represented– 6.0 is not as big a shock as 5.9 was.&nbsp; But, like, as big a change as those represented, it still skates. And that&#8217;s, I think what makes the work especially hard, especially nuanced. And like, we haven&#8217;t gotten together as human beings in two years. And so sometimes people just kind of forget there&#8217;s a human being back there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re humans. Everyone be nice. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know that part of running a release definitely was surprising to me. My first release that I ran was 5.0 and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:20:31] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wow!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:20:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Yeah, it was, like, that was  2018. And then I became the executive director at the top of 2019. And I distinctly remember one core chat where I showed up and just was like the most transparent, vulnerable person we&#8217;ve ever experienced in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not true. We have very vulnerable people in the project and very transparent people, but I told everyone like, there are a million of you and one of me, and it&#8217;s kind of terrifying that you&#8217;re leaping on me in this—like you&#8217;re scaring me a lot right now. And that was quite a thing to say to like, all these… it&#8217;s terrifying! Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:21:12] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love when you see that type of vulnerability in the project. I think it takes… it takes a degree of comfort and familiarity with the project to even be able to admit to that. And to me, that&#8217;s a real sign of growth in the project. Like when I first started contributing, I don&#8217;t think I ever would have just said, like, ‘How is the feature supposed to work? I have no idea.’ That&#8217;s something that I say all the time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Laughter*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, that is completely fine and more than okay. It&#8217;s a massive project. There are folks who have done deep thinking about a feature over the course of years. You know, and there are experts who can help shed light on various problems that maybe you just haven&#8217;t had a chance to dive into yet and really understand the nuances of yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the amazing thing about open source is that you can lean on folks who do have expertise in that particular area. You&#8217;re not expected to be an expert-expert in every single domain. It&#8217;s okay to say, I don&#8217;t really have a good idea or a good concept of this feature. I don&#8217;t have a good feeling for it. What do other folks think?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:22:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even people who have been in the project for a long time, decade plus, still say that all the time. You know, or you might just say, like, I have a really rough idea of how this works, are other people seeing this the same way? Or did other people have a different, you know, mental picture of how this might work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if, sometimes it feels like you&#8217;re over-communicating, it&#8217;s really helpful because often people do have really dramatically different ideas about how a feature might take shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:22:49] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that&#8217;s one of the things that we never lose in the project. Like we are an old, old project now and we support a bunch of the web with a tiny, tiny group of people compared to the amount of the web that we support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that we always have that opportunity as senior leaders, which I am, and all of our upcoming leaders to all of us, just at some point, be like, can we stop the train? I don&#8217;t understand. I don’t understand that. Um, and not necessarily feel that that has made us a worse contributor. Cause I think that it&#8217;s when we are transparent about our lack of understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when we have the opportunity to make what we&#8217;re offering to the world more solid and always better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:23:35] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. I think it&#8217;s the, one of the most lovely things about the WordPress community. There&#8217;s really low judgment around those types of questions and people are really inclusive and more than happy to take a moment to explain something to you or shed some light on an issue you might not have thought that much about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s one of the best things you can always reach out for help. And folks are always willing to provide guidance or context or even historical information about, you know, whether it&#8217;s been tried in the past or previous explorations and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:24:10] </p>\n\n\n\n<p> All right. Well, that covers all of my questions for you. Do you have a final thought about the release that you would like to share with everyone you don&#8217;t have to, if you don&#8217;t want to, not everyone has like a final sign off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:24:25] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. One of the things I&#8217;m most excited about for this 6.0 release is all of the improvements around design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are just small improvements around a ton of different things, like the color panel, border controls, gap support, typography options, flexible container blocks, etc. These are the types of tools that are a designer&#8217;s dream. You know, they really make the difference between being able to make a really crisp, finished looking final product and having something that&#8217;s a little rough around the edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a designer, like those are the things that your eye goes straight towards. And all of these nuanced new tools, they really allow designers to have that fine detailed control to create really pixel perfect sites. And I think that&#8217;s something that, you know, myself and a lot of others on the design team are just so beyond excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:25]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. Well, Channing, thank you so much for joining us today on the WordPress Briefing; it has been an absolute delight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:25:32] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:41] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it is time, woohoo, for the small list of big things. My favorite part of this podcast, that&#8217;s not true. I have a lot of things that I love about this podcast. I just, in particular love being able to share like three things that are coming up in the next couple of weeks that everybody should be aware of. And I really particularly like the list I have this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as of today, we are two weeks away from WordSesh. If you&#8217;re looking forward to your first in-person WordPress event, but feel like you could use a little foundation information, a little bit of a WordPress primer, then this event has a lot of excellent thought leaders in the project that you can learn from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more practical or hands-on opportunities, uh, you can also check out social learning spaces. All of those are free for anyone. So I will include links to both of them in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:26:30]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, as of today, we are four weeks away from WordCamp Europe. This is one of our flagship events. So it also includes a contributor day, which I encourage you to look into. If you have never heard of one before. I will be there to meet some of the contributors that have joined the project since the end of 2019. And hopefully, I will see you there as well. If you&#8217;ve never heard of a contributor day, then I&#8217;ll include a link to the beginner&#8217;s guide to contributions, a little talk that I gave in 2017 in the show notes that should help you get your bearings or at the very least know what questions to ask yourself to figure out if a contributor day is right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing as of today, it has been one week since <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandunn/">Ian Dunn</a> and the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/">Meta</a> developers… Um, that sounds like a band… Ian Dunn and the Meta developers connected the props channel in the community Slack to WordPress.org profile activity. I&#8217;m really excited about this. It&#8217;s the first in a long list of changes that are part of a larger project to credit more non-code contributions, more contributions that are not specific to a major release or event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also to set us up to be able to provide more quality checks and balances for our growing Five for the Future program. If you&#8217;ve not been over there lately, if you&#8217;re not super sure what I&#8217;m talking about, there&#8217;s a link to the discussion post that we had about it, but also you can wander right over into the Making WordPress Slack and check out the props channel to just kind of see a running list of contributors that people are really grateful for.

From using the software as a basic website tool to helping entrepreneurs and good causes around the world fulfill their aspirations, she has overcome personal barriers and now aims to inspire others.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher found her vocation and learned new skills through WordPress. She also discovered a way to encourage other women to consider careers in IT.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Opening the doors to a career in technology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child, Meher was diagnosed with dyslexia (difficulty in reading the written word) and dyscalculia (difficulty in comprehending numbers and mathematical functions). With the support of her parents and a tutor, she was able to overcome this learning obstacle. She developed coping techniques and a determination to work to overcome challenges as they appeared later in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In school, she got an opportunity to replace one subject with computer studies as an alternative. This proved to be an eye-opener to future career possibilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began to research not only what the internet had to offer but also how it worked, including the new and fascinating concepts of email and websites. Her father bought the family’s first desktop computer so she could do her research at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher’s father wanted to turn her love for computers into something that would serve her well in the future. In 2005, he enrolled her in a short computer course from a global IT training provider. The course tutor was so impressed with her performance, she was advised to enroll in a four year software development course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant she had studied the software development course alongside her higher education college course. Looking back, she enjoyed the dual challenge of the degree course in commerce, and the experience prepared her well to keep learning software while working as a developer. Within three years, she had learned C#, C, C++, HTML, Java, and .NET. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduation, she was in a dilemma to choose between commerce and IT. What to choose? She had a compulsory one-year technology internship to complete, and her choice of focus for that year would prove to be a defining moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, on her birthday, Meher was offered an internship. On the first day of the internship, she was introduced to WordPress. Her initial assignment was to change the look and feel of the WordPress dashboard — in just six hours. But there was a problem &#8211; she had never worked with WordPress before!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I stared at the whiteboard and thought that task given was impossible and difficult to meet the deadline. I wondered if my boss was joking and did not know then what you could do with WordPress as a developer and how it could slot into your toolbox. It opened my eyes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher used her research skills to know more about using WordPress. She found a plugin that would help her achieve her task. She met the deadline and it ingrained an interest that she would never lose. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Re-discovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years after her initial WordPress experience, Meher was assigned to lead an international project in WordPress.&nbsp;She was hesitant — she had lost touch with the CMS during that five years, but the project was a great opportunity to become a team leader and lead from the front.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She decided to update her WordPress skills, relying again on the strength of her research skills and determination. In the process, she also taught her team all about WordPress, inspiring many of those members to continue to develop their WordPress skill set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of that project was a pivotal moment for Meher and a new dawn as a developer specializing in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team lead, Meher soon found it was not possible to always have all the answers straight away. She found internet searches gave practical solutions—but rarely explained the theory behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So she went looking for a WordPress group to help her expand the scope and depth of her knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding the community and its developer learning opportunities </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="999" height="667" src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=999%2C667&#038;ssl=1" alt="Meher at WordCamp Nagpur in 2017" class="wp-image-12762" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Meher enjoying being part of <em>WordCamp Nagpur in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, while browsing Facebook, Meher came across an advertisement for something called WordCamp Mumbai, an event that had taken two days before. She did a little digging to learn what a WordCamp was, and about the people behind it. She took the plunge and joined the WordPress Mumbai Meetup group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first Meetup experience was not love at first sight. She felt the topics were for advanced users, and the timing late in the evening made it difficult to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a few months later, the Meetup addressed a topic that could help her resolve an issue in one of her current projects. She made the effort to show up and came away with a number of important tips.&nbsp;The speaker had taken the time to speak to individual attendees. When he came to Meher, she took the opportunity to ask a couple of questions about her project issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter she went to more Meetups and got to know the people behind this group, just as they started talking about WordCamp Mumbai 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A WordCamp adventure</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1" alt="Meher pictured with the WordCamp Mumbai 2016 sign " class="wp-image-12758" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Meher discovering <em>WordCamps in Mumbai in 2016</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher expressed interest in being a part of the coming&nbsp; WordCamp Mumbai and started in an entry-level role with basic responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, she thought WordCamp was a formal conference with about 100 people. So on the first day of WordCamp Mumbai 2016, she was surprised to see so many WordCamp enthusiasts attending and enjoying such a relaxed and friendly conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that great experience, Meher went to many more meetups and did more volunteering. She started taking on responsibilities in the coming WordCamps and getting to know the different aspects of the camp.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following years, at each WordPress, she took up a new role like speaker vetting, sponsors, and volunteer coordination. This allowed her to know more about what an organizer needs to do, from planning to execution, to make WordCamp a successful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="600" src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=900%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="WordCamp Mumbai 2017 group photo of the team" class="wp-image-12765" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>With the team at <em>WordCamp Mumbai in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher is grateful for her WordPress journey which was fostered in the Mumbai community. It has been filled with beautiful surprises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people ask why she’s chosen to specialize professionally in WordPress, Meher says WordPress is easy to teach a non-technical person, yet it is still highly customizable. Being a WordPress developer has given her the opportunity to work&nbsp; remotely for global web development companies that let her think out of the box. And she learns new skills with every release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The community makes WordPress special</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher says that some of her most memorable WordPress moments have revolved around special friendships, trying new things, and participating in community building.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has let her explore different parts of India, make new friends locally and internationally, and encourage women to be a part of meetup groups and events across India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Meher’s biggest dreams was to lead WordCamp Mumbai as a lead organizer and show others what could be achieved by working together in open source. In 2019, she did just that and has volunteered at international WordCamps and meetups since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="515" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&#038;ssl=1" alt="Meher speaking at WordCamp Mumbai 2019" class="wp-image-12731" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?w=1247&amp;ssl=1 1247w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Taking to the stage at WordCamp Mumbai in 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of her enthusiasm for sharing the opportunities WordPress can give people, especially women, she has given time to co-organize two global <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/">WordPress Translation month long events</a> and contributor events in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher said: “I was first introduced to translation at one of the meetups which was organised to support the WordPress Translation Day. I realized this was another way to support my local communities and bring the power of WordPress to them by contributing in Gujarati and Hindi. I did not imagine I would a few years later be a global organizer for the event itself!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her commitment to ongoing learning as a developer and to model what she believes about the value and community growth opportunities of open source, Meher has given time and energy to the Marketing Team, where she has been a Team Rep, to the Training Team, and to the Core Team contributing to multiple releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The developer adventure with WordPress is unlimited</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>At the start of my software developer journey, I always thought the C++ and Java were the only skills you required to excel in your career. From the time I started exploring WordPress in depth, I realized the potential and the power of WordPress in web development.</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a part of the WordPress community, Meher learned that there is so much more than just building blogs on WordPress. She started exploring different features of WordPress, created her first theme, and eventually specialized as a frontend specialist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher now works as a consultant and front end developer with an international agency specializing in WordPress. Asked what she thought was the best thing about being a WordPress developer, Meher replied: &#8220;Through WordPress, I have an opportunity to build unique out of the box websites and work&nbsp;remotely for global web development companies that encourages you to think out of the box. There is always opportunity to continuously advance my coding skills and learn new techniques with every release.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She believes that there is no limit to where using the software can take you and what you can combine it with to find solutions to projects big and small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn a living from WordPress, her advice is from the heart: try to give back to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am sure you will learn or teach something new and definitely make friends across the world. There is no shame in making mistakes, as you can learn from them and develop your skills further. You can also help others as they build their skills.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher added: “Don’t let the things you find difficult get in the way of your success.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), and Meg Phillips (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/megphillips91/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>megphillips91</a>) for interviews, writing and image work on this story.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:39] </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So you&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast for a while. You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning; you may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or, maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their project or business. Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have long since outgrown that, but even 19 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because even after those 19 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same. And that is to democratize publishing, to help people have a place online where they can tell their stories or share their projects or set up their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today. And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, oh, Josepha, how old fashioned? I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. Before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first ever website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s dive in. Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, and some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first. Cause, like, if you want the domain name, wordpress.org, like we own that, you can have that! But if you know that you want a domain like WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com, like that one might be more available. And if you know the kind of words you want in your domain, you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:09]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mentioned all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it’s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start, before you even know what WordPress is most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service where they will keep your WordPress software up to date, provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong. So it ranges all the way from full service like that all the way down to essentially zero services, just kind of hands-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site. But they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you. They leave updating up to you, things like. So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself. And the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software and what you want and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either service with the existing hosts that you chose or moving to a different host; however that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:10]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, the other side of that spectrum that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server or, or you know how to work in this thing called c-panel, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to wordpress.org/download, and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got you covered. In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the Learn WP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host as well as various other early steps of this process. So if you felt like I blazed through all of that, which honestly I kind of did, you can work through those lessons in that course, at your own pace, and it&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this ‘Hello World’ post– there&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page, exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMS in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve got now a website, we know, kind of, how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can kind of be moderated and stuff. And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it&#8217;s not a fun task, if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some, choose your own adventure guiding questions here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words, mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to wordpress.org/themes and and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to wordpress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically so that you can see how things look right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site. So if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely and just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every word, press instance ships with a theme and it is fully functional when you, when you get your site up and running. So you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites is to add plugins to them. So plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want, what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need. Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there; if that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a general side note here, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll tell you this. I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes and on the one hand you definitely can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem. And obviously, here, are some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time. Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009 and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. So I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are the easiest of the hard options for CMS. Like content management systems are just complicated, but we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game, like you should have had a website for years. I mean, sure that could be true. And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. But the second-best time to plant that tree is today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:12:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one, the next release of WordPress, WordPress 6.0, has reached its beta phase. That means the full focus is on finding and fixing the bugs we accidentally created during this development cycle. Beta two comes out tomorrow and you can follow along in the core channel in the Making WordPress Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never seen how those releases get packaged, and if you just want to keep an eye on what everybody&#8217;s doing so that you can be the first to know, yeah, Making WordPress Slack is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list is that speaking of WordPress 6.0, we had the public walk through a couple of weeks ago, which means that in a few weeks, I&#8217;ll do a WordPress 6.0 sneak peek. I&#8217;ll share some highlights of the release features and why I think they are super important for you to take a look. Sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:13:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final, big thing, if you are new to WordPress and this episode has you all fired up to start your blog, we have a bunch of contributors over on the Learn WP team that have just the thing for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can join the online social learning space called How to Make a WordPress Blog. It&#8217;s a free online event that will help you get started. I&#8217;ll link the information in the show notes below. And I&#8217;ll also share in the show notes, a list of WordPress Meetup groups, where you can find more opportunities to learn and get support from other people locally who are also doing things with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can also find a list in the dashboard of your newly installed WordPress blog you no doubt have after this podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"12658";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:63:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"WordPress 6.0 Beta 1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/wordpress-6-0-beta-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 19:08:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"6.0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12644";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Dan Soschin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7809:"\n<p>WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was checking the list of upcoming events recently as part of just my regular work and saw that the call for organizers for WordCamp Asia is open. On the one hand, it made my heart skip a beat with excitement. That event is six years or so in the making. And on the other hand, it reminded me of February 10th, 2020, the day that Matt told me that we had to proactively cancel WordCamp Asia. That week was truly heartbreaking for me as well as I think the entire organizing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also, fortunately, was prescient. As I think back over the two years since then, I&#8217;m grateful for our community wranglers and deputies who have consistently hosted important discussions about how to return to in-person events safely. And with two of our major flagship events returning this year, I&#8217;m here to summarize, sort of, what the rules and guidelines are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But certainly I hope that you come away from this with an idea of what&#8217;s being done to keep everyone safe as we are best able.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, before we dig into specifics, I want to be clear upfront that the guidelines for COVID-aware events are mandatory, unless otherwise stated. For folks who&#8217;ve been attending WordPress events, or participating in the community for a long time, this is a change. As a program, we have always done our best to be flexible with guidelines so that we can prioritize local knowledge. But our responsibility is to the long-term success of this community and this program. So moving forward with in-person events that risk the health of our community members poses risks to the program itself. So with that in mind, let&#8217;s learn what we&#8217;re going to see at events for the rest of the.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any WordPress event that is gathering more than 50 people, the new mandatory guidelines are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, follow local laws and guidelines. If your area has suggested guidelines on top of the mandatory ones, follow those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, is if you are in a location where laws or guidelines require or permit venues to limit admission based on a person&#8217;s vaccination status and masking, then events can only happen in venues that are willing to provide staff to check for vaccination status at the door. And then also to remind participants to wear masks during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is if your area or venue legally cannot check vaccination status, your area must pass the in-person checklist, which I will link in the show notes below. But that in-person checklist has to be passed at the time of the application and then again at the time of the event. And in addition to that, the venue must be willing to provide staff who will remind participants to wear masks and check for temperature during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers in these areas must be prepared to move online or cancel if the region fails the safety checklist, which again, will be linked in the show notes below. So those are the three things and they are pretty dense, but also I think allow for a fair amount of flexibility. There is also a tidy flow chart linked in the sidebar of make.wordpress.org/community that will help you to decide what sort of event your own area can support right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the mandatory guidelines for WordPress events in general right now, but you probably also have a few specific questions. So I&#8217;ve got the three most common questions ready to go with answers from Angela Jin who helped me to kind of pull together the information for this particular podcast props to Angela. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first question, anything specific to know about WordCamp Europe? WordCamp Europe will be following these guidelines as well. All attendees and participants are expected to wear a mask while they are at the event and catering will be offered outside so people can remove their masks to eat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second common question is how will these guidelines change as countries and local governments begin deescalating restrictions and safety measures? We should consider these guidelines to be subject to evolution based on what the team is hearing and seeing from the community. But right now we intend to keep these stricter guidelines in place until we see how the loosened rules play out elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a third frequent question is what&#8217;s going to happen to all these online events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community team will continue to support online events right now. So if your community doesn&#8217;t feel ready to have an in-person event, but still wants to kind of get everyone together that is still allowed, and still&nbsp; encouraged. And finally the community team will continue to keep a close eye on situations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it becomes safe to do so, and your community is interested, they of course will be happy to chat with you about a WordCamp. There is an application that I will share the link to in the show notes below as well. In case that is something that your community is wanting to look into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and I have a little postscript also. I know I was like finally, and now I&#8217;m doing a finally, finally. That&#8217;s what postscripts are about. P.S. If you have not stopped by the community team’s site or any of their meetings, they&#8217;ve been doing a really great job of keeping things moving through two years of unpredictable changes. If you are a community team member, I want to offer you a huge thanks. Thank you so much for helping us to stay aware and able to move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an organizer, pat yourself on the back. I want to thank you for pivoting with us, moving through online events, even though they are not at all the same as in-person events and certainly they don&#8217;t share the reasons that we get people together sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, if you are an end to end attendee, if you go to WordPress meetups or you go to any sort of WordPress online events or WordCamps, anything like that, thank your local organizer. They have been doing this probably for a while, and I&#8217;m sure that they are looking forward to getting back to in-person events themselves, but even, so they have been putting in a lot of volunteer hours to help make sure that we all know how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so find them, thank them, and I&#8217;m sure that they&#8217;ll appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, it is time for our small list of big things. Number one, WordCamp Asia has a call for organizers open! This event will be in 2023. And I think that we all simply cannot wait. So I&#8217;ll link the call for organizers in the show notes. And then of course you can follow that whole site to stay up to date on what&#8217;s happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is, while we&#8217;re on the topic of events, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about how we can best support organizers who are getting back to in-person events. We&#8217;d like thoughts from both organizers and attendees. So feel free to drop by and leave a note in the comments section. And while you&#8217;re over there, the third thing in my small list of big things, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about regional events. So go over there, get all your thoughts about WordPress events together. Get them all sorted out in one go. Just leave comments, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. All over the place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my most embarrassing WordCamp story actually has to do with where I was supposed to be versus where people thought I was supposed to be. This was early on in my time with WordPress, with Automattic. And I had convinced someone, I had convinced a colleague and friend of mine to go to my home WordCamp, WordCamp Fayetteville over there in Arkansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I didn&#8217;t go. But I knew I wasn&#8217;t going, I knew I was going to WordCamp Boston, but he did not know that I was not going to go. And so he arrived at WordCamp Fayetteville, WordCamp Northwest Arkansas. I can&#8217;t remember what it was called at the time. And immediately was confused about where I was and why I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there was this excellent moment of mass confusion among states where the folks at WordCamp Fayetteville started tweeting about how I had convinced this contributor to go to that event and then didn&#8217;t show up. And then the folks at WordCamp Boston, we&#8217;re looking at all of those tweets, because if you are a WordCamp organizer, you are always looking at the tweets from all the other WordCamps happening in your weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people got very confused about why I was in Boston while they were thinking that I was in Fayetteville, even though the tweets were talking about how, like, I wasn&#8217;t in Fayetteville. They probably didn&#8217;t say that it was probably more along the lines of like, “Hey, let&#8217;s share a photo with Josepha” to, like, make fun of the fact that I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I caused mass confusion in multiple states.

For Juan Aldasoro, a developer and product manager for a large distributed company, it provides an opportunity to combine his different interests and skills to live the type of life he wanted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I like visual, creative and technical things. The joy of WordPress is that you can do all of these things, you don’t have to limit yourself to any one aspect . You can also do this from almost anywhere in the world!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From working in products since 2012, Juan sees WordPress as a major part of his skillset and toolbox. He said: “It gives you an opportunity to be part of building a product which could potentially be used by thousands of people and more on your site. It encourages you to think about different languages and how you can make it accessible. It allows you to work on different platforms. Working in WordPress gives you this broad approach. Working this way on products ended up pushing me into learning about all these different things. Only in open source can you really do this and use your creative side to find solutions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Learning about being part of a community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="924" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&#038;ssl=1" alt="Juan standing in a astreet with murals behind him" class="wp-image-12529" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C693&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1386&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1847&amp;ssl=1 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in a mid-sized city in Argentina, Juan was raised in a family in which music, arts and sports were always an essential part of everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These activities encourage human beings to be creative and participative, and at the same time they are highly formative when it comes to mould people in order to become part of a group, a team, a community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The youngest of five siblings, Juan became highly motivated, trying to follow the steps of his siblings. Having a computer at home, he started to make connections that laid the foundation for his career as a developer. His interest in computers grew through that access to a machine running MS-DOS &#8211; the one with the black screen command line! Mastering this became a challenge to him and something to share with others. Through doing this, he found a way to more social interaction and new friendships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “I started learning some super easy stuff that made me feel like Houdini at that time. I could save a game play, something intangible, on a floppy disk and carry that piece of plastic and magnetic material back home. I was saving the play or game in a square object and then loading that back at home. I now realize, those were my first interactions with computer commands. Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code in a unique way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interest grew further through computer magazines and experimenting as &#8220;there was always something new to learn.” Although sport became a big part of Juan’s life in his teens, he kept up his computer learning. Taking a new direction, he found online tutorials enabling him to learn how to play the guitar. This led to setting up a punk rock band with his friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Education has always been important in my family, and thanks to my parent’s efforts, I attended a school where I learned to express myself in another language.” The school had hired a satellite internet connection in the mid-nineties and had HTML on the computer studies program. These facilities were not that common in Argentina or many other countries either at that time. Also, his parents had the foresight to secure a rare internet connection at the house in 1997. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan recalled: “Browsing around the Internet opened a new universe in my mind. This new universe was extremely fantastic but also extremely expensive. I needed to make the most of every second online.”<br><br>“It was a whole new world and one thing led to the other. I started learning a bit of everything, editing graphics, scripting and so on. I still remember my first website in the fantastic sunset strip, Geocities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trying to go pro</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After high school, Juan moved to the city along with his brother and began to study IT at University. When he was asked by a friend to work at a software company, he decided to try that whilst continuing his studies. Through his job he had the chance to explore web-related opportunities, and with a friend from university, they started managing teams and projects across Latin America and Spain.<br><br>Juan describes this experience as one of the most fulfilling in his life. He was able to travel abroad for work, experience remote working, manage teams, present projects and speak formally in front of senior people. As the company grew at a fast pace, they learned how to set up and run a large organization. Eventually, he decided to drop out of his university program and focus on the opportunity of learning first hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Juan riding a bicycle in a historical city during his travels" class="wp-image-12509" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key early learning from working internationally was that business and web development could be just as fast-moving and successful in Argentina as in other places. “I realized there’s no such thing as a secret sauce for success. Projects are backed by people’s talent and time, and you can find that in any latitude.”<br><br>By his mid-20s, Juan decided he wanted to try building something from scratch. He created a social network for photo sharing in Latin America, which was used by more than 30,000 people across Latin America and Spain in its time. Through this, he discovered that other people had a blog and he did not want to be left behind. The discovery of WordPress was to change the focus of his life.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hello to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spending some time traveling around Europe, Juan found himself ‘surrounded by uncertainty’ and worried about what the future could bring. “I had some clues, but under uncertainty, the more you ask the less you answer. I started thinking about embracing the following philosophy: I didn’t want to be part of a large company, I didn’t want to continue studying and I wanted to travel as much as I could.” He did not realize at that time how this vision for his life was to mirror what he would find in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started using WordPress for a few sites in 2005. By 2007 he was using it for almost everything. He was struck by the magnitude and range of what the software could do, from a simple tool used to create a blog in the blink of an eye through to complex projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first problem-solving project was simple and saved data received through a contact form plugin. “To complete this project I discovered the Codex and I learned how easy and intuitive it is to create a plugin. I had fallen in love with WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As he explored the options with the software, Juan was unsure of how intellectual property worked and wanted to be respectful of other people’s work. “I didn’t understand open source yet, and I wasn’t sure if I was stealing from others. That was my first interaction with GPL and open source. I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others and improve things created by others or by myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He realized: “WordPress was the way to go if I wanted to pursue a dream of traveling, skipping winter, and working at the same time; what we now call a digital nomad. I already knew how to work remotely, I could work for companies located anywhere, as long as they could communicate in English or Spanish.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan started his own web agency, where he provided services to small and medium-sized companies abroad in the USA, UK, and Australia. He built his reputation and developed strong relationships in WordPress. “The experience couldn’t be better. I was learning, having fun, making a living out of it, and at the same time exploring the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In mid-2012, he discovered the full power of the WordPress community firsthand. In his spare time he started developing themes and from all he heard, wanted to attend a major event with lots of others in WordPress, a WordCamp. He took the plunge and booked for WordCamp in Edinburgh, in the UK. He said: “I got to meet many super talented people, and the atmosphere of the event was awesome. A place where competitors were also colleagues. Seeing the humility of somebody like Mike Little, the co-founder of WordPress, was amazing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “While there, unconsciously, I started dreaming of holding something like that in Argentina &#8211; the joy of hosting the WordPress community in my home country.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back home, while browsing the Codex, he happened to see that WordPress was turning 10. A lot of meetups were going to be organized worldwide to celebrate the birthday. But there was nothing organized in Argentina. This was a catalyst for starting a local meetup. Together with a colleague, he&nbsp; organized an Argentinian 10th birthday meetup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 20 people showed up. “There was a common denominator. We all loved WordPress, it was part of our day-to-day life. We wanted to share experiences, make new friends and continue growing from what we could learn from others. That day we were a group of people with shared interests. That’s the simplest way to define a community, isn’t it?” This early meetup led to the formation of what is now called <a href="http://wpargentina.org/">WordPress Argentina</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his desire to skip winters and do more traveling, his next adventure was to take him to visit family working in the US and attend one of the biggest WordCamps in the world in San Francisco. His interest kept growing and he traveled across Europe to be part of the first edition of WordCamp Europe in the Netherlands in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “There’s almost nothing I could write to fully express what you experience in such events. They are the main WordPress events worldwide. The best part: I made a lot of good friends from many different places. I’m glad I have more excuses to continue traveling.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again in Argentina, our organization started growing thanks to the energy of the whole group, we started hosting formal meetups. In May 2015, we crowned all these efforts with a new <a href="https://buenosaires.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp in Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Juan speaking at WordCamp Buenos Aires" class="wp-image-12528" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Organizing such an event in my home country with many of the contributors I had met from the very first meetup was an experience I will always keep with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan believes one of his biggest contributions to open source was as part of being able to expand the community in Argentina and to share this with other Latin American and Spanish speaking countries. He also contributes as a volunteer translator in the Polyglots Team, to the Make WordPress Support team, and contributes to code blocks and Gutenberg. “I am really excited about seeing the future of Gutenberg as it is the future of WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout his time contributing, Juan believes in helping to set the foundations and encouraging others to give their time and talents. He is keen to share that contributing does not have to be the same all the time and that you can have breaks and focus on one area in a particular period too. He gives the example of how in his spare time he watches Trac, where tickets about the software are logged, and looks where he might be able to help or think of solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Anytime I find I can contribute to or make improvements in code-related areas, I will do as it is important to keep giving to the community. I enjoy crawling over meta, trac, GitHub and the different places that are requesting help. There is always somewhere you can help. At the moment, my focus is code and translations. I always try to save time to help these two areas. It is like you give and you get, you learn things. You meet amazing people and opportunities arrive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding your path in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="Juan sat in a street cafe surrounded by parked motorcycles" class="wp-image-12527" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Life is about experiences, it is about the people you surround yourself with and trying to do what you love.

Alentamos encarecidamente a las comunidades locales a continuar organizando WordCamps. A diferencia de las WordCamps tradicionales de varios días, pueden organizar eventos más pequeños que son similares a un formato de un día, pero se beneficiarán de los beneficios de las WordCamp, como el patrocinio, etc.</li><li>Las comunidades locales deberían alentar a los nuevos voluntarios y continuar agregando nuevos miembros a los puestos de liderazgo.</li><li>Si una comunidad quiere organizar una WordCamp regional, debe tener una representación adecuada de todas las reuniones locales y debe tener un nuevo conjunto de organizadores.

Explora más formas de agilizar tu proceso de creación de contenidos, incluyendo:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Selecciona texto de varios bloques y edítalo todo a la vez.</li><li>Teclea dos corchetes abiertos&nbsp;<code>[[</code>&nbsp;para acceder rápidamente al menú de enlaces.</li><li>Conserva los estilos existentes cuando transformas algunos bloques de un tipo a otro, por ejemplo, de un bloque de párrafo a un bloque de código.</li><li>Crea botones personalizados y cualquier nuevo botón que crees mantendrá automáticamente las personalizaciones de estilo.</li><li>Haz las nubes de etiquetas y los iconos sociales aún más atractivos con ajustes y controles actualizados y un nuevo estilo de contorno para la nube de etiquetas.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cambio de estilo</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/about-60-style-switching.gif"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="602" height="452" src="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/about-60-style-switching.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-88495" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Los temas de bloques incluyen ahora la opción para contener múltiples variaciones de estilo. Esto amplía aún más el nuevo sistema de estilos y permite atajos para cambiar el aspecto de tu sitio en un tema individual. Puedes cambiar tanto los ajustes disponibles, como el grosor de la fuente, y las opciones de estilo, como la paleta de colores por defecto. Cambia el aspecto de tu sitio con solo unos pocos clics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Más opciones de plantillas</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="595" src="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-88491" srcset="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.jpeg 1024w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates-300x174.jpeg 300w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates-768x446.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 incluye cinco nuevas opciones de plantilla: Autor, fecha, categorías, etiqueta y taxonomía. Esas plantillas adicionales proporcionan una mayor flexibilidad a los creadores de contenido.

Si eres autor de un tema de bloques, incluso puedes&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/02/new-features-for-working-with-patterns-and-themes-in-wordpress-6-0/">registrar patrones desde el directorio de patrones usando el archivo&nbsp;<code>theme.json</code></a>, permitiéndote priorizar patrones específicos que son más útiles para los usuarios de tu tema.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Herramientas adicionales de diseño</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Las herramientas de diseño son más potentes e intuitivas con cada versión.<br>Algunos aspectos destacados de la versión 6.0 incluyen:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Un nuevo diseño del panel de color ahorra espacio, pero sigue mostrando tus opciones de un vistazo.</li><li>Los nuevos controles de los bordes ofrecen una forma más sencilla de establecer tus bordes exactamente como tú quieres.</li><li>Los niveles de transparencia para tus colores permiten opciones de color aún más creativas.</li><li>Controla los espacios, los márgenes, la tipografía y mucho más en una colección de bloques, todos a la vez, en el bloque de grupo.</li><li>Cambia entre las variaciones de pila, fila y grupo para colocar grupos de bloques con más flexibilidad de diseño.</li><li>Usa la funcionalidad de compatibilidad con espacios en el bloque de galería para crear diferentes aspectos, desde añadir espacio entre todas las imágenes, hasta eliminar el espacio por completo.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mejor vista de lista</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/List-view.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="595" src="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/List-view.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-88493" srcset="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/List-view.jpeg 1024w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/List-view-300x174.jpeg 300w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/List-view-768x446.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Los nuevos atajos del teclado te permiten seleccionar varios bloques de la vista de lista, modificarlos en lotes y arrastrarlos y soltarlos dentro de la lista. La vista de lista se puede abrir y cerrar fácilmente; viene cerrada por defecto y se abre automáticamente en la selección actual cada vez que seleccionas un bloque.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Controles de bloqueo de bloques</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="595" src="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-88494" srcset="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.jpeg 1024w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls-300x174.jpeg 300w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls-768x446.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahora puedes bloquear tus bloques.

Los traductores de la comunidad continúan después del lanzamiento asegurando que haya más traducciones en camino. Gracias a todos los que ayudan a que WordPress esté disponible en 205 idiomas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muchas gracias a todos los voluntarios de la comunidad que contribuyen a los <a href="https://es.wordpress.org/support/forums/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">foros de soporte</a> respondiendo a las preguntas de los usuarios de WordPress de todo el mundo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si te atrae la idea de contribuir a WordPress, es fácil saber más y participar.

El proyecto cree que un gran software debe funcionar con una configuración mínima, para que puedas centrarte en compartir tu historia, producto o servicios libremente. El software básico de WordPress es sencillo y predecible para que puedas empezar a utilizarlo fácilmente. También ofrece potentes funciones para el crecimiento y el éxito.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress cree en la democratización de la publicación y en <a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">las libertades que conlleva el código abierto</a>. Para respaldar esta idea existe una gran comunidad de personas que colaboran y contribuyen a este proyecto. La comunidad de WordPress es acogedora e inclusiva. La pasión de nuestros colaboradores impulsa el éxito de WordPress que, a su vez, te ayuda a alcanzar tus objetivos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aprende más sobre WordPress</a> y cómo puedes unirte a nuestra comunidad para ayudar a dar forma al futuro de la plataforma web más popular del mundo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Un haiku de la versión</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre class="wp-block-verse">Seis punto cero está aquí\nEs hora de descargar y actualizar\nPero hagamos una pausa, para celebrarlo</pre>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"https://es.wordpress.org/2022/05/25/wordpress-6-0-arturo/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:73:"\n		\n		\n					\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n					\n			\n		\n		\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:126:"Como he acabado de no saber que existía la comunidad WordPress a organizar una WordCamp Irún en 5 años.

Por aquel entonces ni le conocía.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luego descubrí que tenemos un montón de amigos en común y otros que hemos hecho juntos. Pero volvamos a WordPress que me lío.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Como soy de los que se apuntan a un bombardeo, acepté la invitación al evento, y aparecí en el lugar y hora indicada. Allí había gente de los cuales algunos y algunas conocía de vista y otros muchos que no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahí es donde apareció por primera vez en mi vida Pablo Moratinos, se puso de píe delante de todos y nos explico en que consistía una Meetup de WordPress, todos escuchamos con atención y nos gustó la idea. Yo ya participaba en otros grupos de sinergias y me pareció una buena oportunidad de crear sinergias y de adquirir conocimiento. Después de las explicaciones del funcionamiento ya concretamos una nueva cita y ese fue el germen que me ha llevado a donde estoy ahora.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cada mes organizamos una charla, algunas las hacia Pablo, había que incitar a la gente y tenían que ver como funcionaba el tema, pero enseguida se animó gente con charlas sobre fotografía, sobre SEO. Y después de cada charla quedábamos para tomar unas cervezas, una parte importante de lo que es una Meetup. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Con el paso de los meses el grupo ya estaba mas afianzado, hay asistentes que no fallamos y muchos que han ido viniendo cuando han podido. En una de las reuniones Pablo nos sugirió organizar una WordCamp, y a la mayoría nos tuvo que explicar que es lo que estaba diciendo, porque para la mayoría la comunidad WordPress era una cosa a la que solo tenia acceso él.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yo, como he dicho anteriormente, me apunto a un bombardeo así que enseguida dije que le podía ayudar con el diseño de las cosas que necesitará, así que es como acabe desarrollando el primer logo de la WordCamp Irún.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun18.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun18-1009x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-88471" width="505" height="512" srcset="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun18-1009x1024.jpg 1009w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun18-296x300.jpg 296w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun18-768x779.jpg 768w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun18.jpg 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Y de paso diseñé los programas, los roll ups, la web, las camisetas, etc… ¡Y oh! Sorpresa no había presentador para el Track B. ¿adivináis a quien le tocó? ¡Bingo! Si a mi. Así es como acabe metido de lleno en mi primera WordCamp, presentando un evento que no sabia que era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y llegó el día. Bueno, los que estuvisteis ya lo sabes, todo fue muy bien&#8230; no voy a contar las cosas de camerinos, pero conocí mi primera WordCamp. Y me encantó. El sábado por la noche después de la After Party ya estábamos organizando la de 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ese año conocimos que <strong>la comunidad podíamos ser nosotros también</strong>, y cada uno hizo sus pinitos en las secciones que pudo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yo durante el año no pude ir a ninguna otra WordCamp, por aquel entonces tenia un niño de poco mas de 3 años (ahora ya son 3) y una empresa en pleno lanzamiento.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En 2019 repetimos la WordCamp, y sacamos las charlas a la calle, una acción que tuvo mucha repercusión pero que nos volvió locos. Aquí ya conseguí hacer un logo que nos representará mas.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun19.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun19-725x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88472" width="363" height="512" srcset="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun19-725x1024.png 725w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun19-213x300.png 213w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun19-768x1084.png 768w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun19-1088x1536.png 1088w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun19.png 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>No voy a entrar en detalles, la cuestión aquí es que al acabar esta WordCamp Pablo nos explicó que un Head Organicer solo puede serlo 2 años, y es cuando todo el equipo de organización se giró hacia a mi&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Después de Pablo en aquel equipo era el único que tenia una profesión relacionada con el mundillo y era la opción lógica, así que no tuve escapatoria, pero tampoco lo peleé mucho. Llego el 2020 y empezamos a organizar la WordCamp. Con todos los patrocinadores y ponentes mandando sus ponencias llego la Pandemia. En un principio pensábamos que nos libraríamos, china había estado 3 meses confinada y la ilusión nos hizo pensar que podríamos conseguirlo… luego nos dieron la bofetada y tuvimos que cancelar y ver que la pandemia era una cosa más seria y sobre todo más larga.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahora después de dos años de charlas online y multitud de cursos online, estamos todos un poco hartos de vernos a través de una pantalla y queremos abrazarnos, y <strong>ESTAR</strong> con las personas que tanto hemos visto en redes o en Zoom. </p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun22.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/logoirun22.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88473" width="300" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Y en esas, <strong>mañana empieza la <a href="https://irun.wordcamp.org/2022/">WordCamp Irún 2022</a>.</strong> Nos dijimos que organizaríamos una WordCamp sin muchas expectativas, solo para juntarnos con la gente, pero con el paso de los días me surgió una pregunta <strong>¿Qué hay mas importante que juntarte con la gente que quieres?</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/WordCamp-Irun-1536x1024-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/WordCamp-Irun-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-88474" width="512" height="342" srcset="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/WordCamp-Irun-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/WordCamp-Irun-1536x1024-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/WordCamp-Irun-1536x1024-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/WordCamp-Irun-1536x1024-1.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Es por ello que te invito a consultar <a href="https://irun.wordcamp.org/2022/programa/">el programa</a> donde hablaremos de muchos temas de actualidad, relacionados con la tecnología o no y con WordPress o no.  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Además, de descansos para hacer networking y darnos esos abrazos que te decía antes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y si no quieres perderte esta ocasión y venirte, aún quedan las <a href="https://irun.wordcamp.org/2022/tickets/">últimas entradas</a>.

Y creo que esto pasa muy a menudo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En el año 2018 asistí a mi primera meetup con el grupo de WordPress Valladolid, fue una charla que se llamaba <strong>Creación de una web en WordPress desde cero… ¡la nuestra!</strong> que me pareció muy interesante.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seguí asistiendo a las charlas que organizaba este grupo porque podía aprender nuevas herramientas o funcionalidades y además también conocer gente nueva. Después de un tiempo recibí un mensaje del organizador de este grupo ofreciéndome la posibilidad de unirme al equipo de organización junto a él y más personas (recientemente él se había quedado solo al frente del grupo).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A partir de ese momento pude ir conociendo a un montón de gente que colaboraba con el grupo. Al poco tiempo se unió algún compañero más, uno concretamente había asistido a varias WordCamp nacionales e internacionales y llegaba con ganas de que hiciéramos algo parecido en Valladolid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En septiembre de 2019 varios compañeros de la meetup WordPress Valladolid fuimos a la WordCamp de Pontevedra, la mayoría de ellos iban como voluntarios o ponentes. Pensé que al no conocer a nadie y como el resto de mis compañeros estarían ocupados iba a estar sola, pero no me sentí así en ningún momento.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allí pude conocer a un montón de gente o reencontrarme con algunos conocidos que habían colaborado con el grupo de Valladolid impartiendo alguna charla.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La sensación en el viaje de vuelta es que me quedaba con ganas de más, por suerte no se acabo allí. Al poco me hicieron la propuesta de ayudar a organizar la próxima WordCamp Valladolid y aunque nerviosa por como lo haría, dije que sí.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seguimos con los preparativos para la WordCamp de Valladolid que se iba a celebrar en febrero de 2020. Esta vez podría vivirla desde dentro, en vez de cómo asistente. Fueron días de muchos nervios y preparativos para que todo saliera bien y la gente se quedara con buenas impresiones del evento.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>El organizar una WordCamp requiere muchos preparativos y estar pendiente de muchos temas, algunos de los compañeros de la organización ya habían participado en la organización de otras WordCamp o colaborado como voluntarios, en mi caso ninguna de las dos cosas, por tanto aunque fui la encargada del merchandising, tocaba dejarse guiar por los que tenían más experiencia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Habitualmente teníamos reuniones de equipo para poner en común las cosas que ya habíamos avanzado y también contamos con la ayuda de un mentor que nos echaba una mano en las cosas que dudábamos cómo plantearlas o si llevarlas a cabo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>El jueves empezamos con un encuentro para todo el que quisiera asistir e ir calentando motores, el viernes fue el día de la comunidad y el sábado el día fuerte con todas las ponencias.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/49607947548_053b7ab323_c.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="799" height="533" src="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/49607947548_053b7ab323_c.jpg" alt="(Wordcamp Valladolid 2020)" class="wp-image-88308" srcset="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/49607947548_053b7ab323_c.jpg 799w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/49607947548_053b7ab323_c-300x200.jpg 300w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/49607947548_053b7ab323_c-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px" /></a><figcaption>(Wordcamp Valladolid 2020)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Durante estos dos años de parón, en los que no se han podido realizar eventos presenciales, he seguido participando y colaborando en eventos online, dónde he podido conocer a un montón de gente más, a la que tengo ganas de desvirtualizar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Después de resumir mi experiencia en la comunidad, participar en ella te puede aportar:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Conocer a gente de diferentes lugares, que pueden convertirse en buenos amigos.</li><li>Encontrar compañeros con los que puedas colaborar en un futuro en diferentes proyectos.</li><li>Aprender cosas nuevas.</li><li>En los eventos nunca te sentirás sólo, porque siempre encontrarás a alguien con quien charlar.</li><li>Contribuir con la comunidad de WordPress, lo cual te puede aportar diferentes beneficios como mejorar tu CV o darte a conocer en la comunidad. </li><li>Si te apetece hablar o enseñar a los demás como desarrollas tu trabajo o las herramientas que utilizas puedes practicar en los pequeños eventos que se hacen en las comunidades locales y si después te atreves dar el salto a hacerlo en una WordCamp.</li><li>Puedes organizar eventos relacionados con WordPress en tu ciudad o municipio.</li><li>Cuando necesites ayuda, siempre puedes recurrir a la red de WordPress, alguien te podrá dar un consejo o indicar qué herramienta utiliza, etc.</li><li>Disfrutar del buen networking después de las meetups y de la afterparty que se celebra a continuación de la WordCamp. </li><li>Hacer turismo.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>¿Y a ti que te ha aportado la comunidad de WordPress?

desarrolladores relacionadas con la versión 6.0</a> en las próximas semanas, que detallarán todos los próximos cambios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>¿Qué hay en WordPress 6.0 RC1?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Desde la última Beta se han abordado varios elementos, incluidos (entre otros): </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Actualizaciones de backport de las pruebas de bloques de comentarios ( <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55643">#55643</a> )</li><li>Adaptar una corrección de errores de la paginación del bloque de la plantilla de comentarios ( <a

href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55567">#55567</a> )</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 es el segundo lanzamiento importante para 2022, después de la 5.9, que estuvo disponible para el público en general en enero. Esta versión incluye casi 1.000 correcciones y mejoras que abarcan la mayoría de las áreas de la plataforma de WordPress. Algunos aspectos destacados clave dentro de los conjuntos de características de creación de contenido y creación de sitios incluyen:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cambio de estilo: </strong><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/03/core-editor-improvement-choose-your-style/">cambia la apariencia de tu sitio</a> , todo con un tema de bloques. ¡No es necesario cambiar de tema!</li><li><strong>Más opciones de plantilla:</strong> usa bloques para editar cinco plantillas más (autor, fecha, categorías, etiqueta y taxonomía).</li><li><strong>Selección múltiple:</strong> selecciona fácilmente texto en varios bloques. Edita a tu gusto.</li><li><strong>Retener estilos:</strong> conserva tus estilos personalizados en su lugar, ya sea transformándolos entre bloques o creando nuevos botones. </li><li><strong>Más patrones en más lugares:</strong> el insertador rápido muestra patrones que podrían funcionar bien para la situación en la que estés, horneando patrones relevantes para las partes de la plantilla y las páginas en las que estás trabajando. </li><li><strong>Mejoras en la vista de lista:</strong> los nuevos métodos abreviados de teclado (Mayús + clic) te permiten seleccionar varios bloques para modificar de forma masiva (recolocar, eliminar, etc.), ver tu contenido de un vistazo con una vista plegada por defecto y más.</li><li><strong>Herramientas de diseño refinadas:</strong> explora un nuevo panel de colores, opciones de transparencia, más variaciones de bloques de grupo para crear nuevas opciones de diseño (pila, fila), la capacidad de configurar tu imagen destacada en un bloque de fondo, controla el tamaño exacto de tu imagen destacada, compatibilidad con espacios en el bloque de galería y más.</li><li><strong>Nuevos bloques:</strong> varios comentarios de publicaciones, leer más, sin resultados en el bucle de consulta, publicación de biografía del autor, bloques de avatar. </li><li><strong>Bloqueo de bloques:</strong> elige desactivar la opción de eliminar un bloque, moverlo o ambos, directamente en el editor. </li><li><strong>Exportar temas de bloques:</strong> explora la herramienta mejorada de exportación de temas de bloques, ya que WordPress se acerca a la creación de temas de bloques visuales sin código.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Desarrolladores de temas y plugins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Todos los desarrolladores de plugins y temas deberían probar sus respectivas extensiones con WordPress 6.0 RC1 y actualizar la versión «<em>Probado hasta»</em> en el archivo <em>readme</em> a la versión 6.0. Si encuentras problemas de compatibilidad, asegúrate de publicar información detallada en los <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/">foros de soporte</a> , para que estos elementos puedan investigarse más a fondo antes de la fecha de lanzamiento final del 24 de mayo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revisa la <em><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/">guía de campo de WordPress 6.0</a></em> para obtener más detalles sobre el contenido de esta versión.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Traduce WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>¿Hablas un idioma que no sea el inglés? <a

Tras varios meses ya tenemos los primeros resultados.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>El objetivo inicial del grupo ha sido triple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Por un lado, tenemos las propuestas de mejoras con respecto a los formatos de imágenes. Lo que se quiere conseguir es el uso de WebP como formato por defecto, lo que significa que, en un futuro, cuando se suba una imagen JPEG se convertirá automáticamente a WebP y será la que se utilice. Si más adelante aparecen formatos óptimos, se haría el cambio por esos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La segunda línea es la informativa, y para ello se utilizará el Salud del Sitio, donde comenzaremos a ver notificaciones sobre el soporte a WebP, la cantidad de recursos CSS y JavaScript encolados o la posibilidad y necesidad de utilizar una caché de objetos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Para acabar, aunque en este caso va directamente al núcleo de WordPress, se está trabajando en mejorar las funciones y funcionalidades de la caché de objetos. Estos cambios comenzarán a verse ya en la próxima versión de WordPress 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><em>Performance Lab: el plugin</em></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Con la creación de este grupo de trabajo también se planteó la posibilidad de crear un plugin para hacer experimentos. Antes de incluir cualquier novedad en el núcleo de WordPress pasaría por este plugin. Es un plugin seguro, ya que las funciones experimentales vienen desactivadas por defecto.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-plugin-directory wp-block-embed-plugin-directory"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HrJk1cz4iY"><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/">Performance Lab</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="«Performance Lab» — Plugin Directory" src="https://es.wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/embed/#?secret=4n0vY0xIAR#?secret=HrJk1cz4iY" data-secret="HrJk1cz4iY" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>El plugin <a href="https://es.wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/">Performance Lab</a>, en su versión 1.0.0-beta.1, que es su primera versión, incluye cuatro experimentos.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Subidas de WebP</strong>: Crea versiones WebP para las nuevas subidas de imágenes JPEG si el alojamiento es compatible.</li><li><strong>Compatibilidad con WebP</strong>: Añade una comprobación de compatibilidad para WebP en el estado de Salud del Sitio.</li><li><strong>Comprobación del estado de la caché de objetos persistente</strong>: Añade una comprobación de la caché de objetos persistente para los sitios con una cantidad no trivial de datos en el estado de la salud del sitio.</li><li><strong>Auditoría de recursos en cola</strong>: Añade una comprobación de recursos CSS y JS en el estado de Salud del Sitio.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Una vez tengamos el plugin instalado, podemos visitar la sección de <strong>Ajustes &gt; Rendimiento</strong> donde encontraremos la posibilidad de activar o desactivar las distintas pruebas.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/perflab-configuracion.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="545" src="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/perflab-configuracion-1024x545.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88335" srcset="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/perflab-configuracion-1024x545.png 1024w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/perflab-configuracion-300x160.png 300w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/perflab-configuracion-768x409.png 768w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/perflab-configuracion.png 1116w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Activar Subidas de WebP</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>La opción de subidas de WebP aún es muy limitada. Al subir la imagen en JPEG se van a crear las imágenes más pequeñas en formato WebP, pero, todavía no, la imagen original. Se puede insertar la imagen con el mismo nombre, pero cambiando la extensión .jpg por .webp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Este módulo sufrirá bastantes mejoras en próximas versiones, y se incorporarán sistemas sencillos para que los usuarios no tengan que hacer nada, o puedan elegir qué formato desean utilizar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Salud del Sitio</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/perflab-saludsitio.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="807" height="604" src="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/perflab-saludsitio.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88336" srcset="https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/perflab-saludsitio.png 807w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/perflab-saludsitio-300x225.png 300w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/perflab-saludsitio-768x575.png 768w, https://es.wordpress.org/files/2022/04/perflab-saludsitio-440x330.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>En la sección de Estado del Salud del Sitio nos encontraremos con cuatro nuevos bloques de información sobre el estado del sitio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scripts en cola</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Este bloque nos indicará de la cantidad de JavaScript que temas y plugins incluyen de forma extra. Nos informará si estamos usando una cantidad justa o excesiva de elementos y su tamaño total.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Estilos en cola</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Este bloque nos indicará de la cantidad de CSS que temas y plugins incluyen de forma extra. Nos informará si estamos usando una cantidad justa o excesiva de elementos y su tamaño total.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Compatibilidad WebP</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Informa sobre la posibilidad o no de utilizar el nuevo formato WebP. En general el uso depende mucho de la versión de PHP que tengas y de las extensiones instaladas, además de la configuración del hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Caché de Objetos persistente</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress incorpora de forma nativa el soporte a distintos sistemas de caché de objetos persistentes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>El mensaje te informará sobre la necesidad o no de utilizar una, y en caso de tener esa disponibilidad, de cómo activarla o solicitar a tu proveedor de hosting que lo haga.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><em>Mejorar WordPress</em></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aunque esta es una versión muy básica del plugin, es la primera que lanza el equipo con el foco en que poco a poco se vaya incluyendo estas mejoras en las siguientes versiones de WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si pruebas el plugin y tienes sugerencias o dudas o nuevas ideas, puedes <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues">abrir un ticket en la sección de issues de su Github</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si te interesan las mejoras de rendimiento de WordPress, recuerda visitar la <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/performance/">página del grupo de WordPress Performance</a> y participar en su <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02KGN5K076">chat semanal en Slack</a> (actualmente, los martes a las 16:00 UTC).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Redactado: <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/javiercasares/">Javier Casares</a></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"https://es.wordpress.org/2022/04/11/performance-lab-probando-mejoras-de-rendimiento-en-wordpress/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:82:"\n		\n		\n					\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n					\n			\n		\n		\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"WordPress 5.9.3 – Actualización de mantenimiento";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"https://es.wordpress.org/2022/04/06/wordpress-5-9-3-actualizacion-de-mantenimiento/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"https://es.wordpress.org/2022/04/06/wordpress-5-9-3-actualizacion-de-mantenimiento/#respond";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Apr 2022 08:21:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Actualizaciones";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Mantenimiento";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"5.9";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"5.9.3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"https://es.wordpress.org/?p=88318";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:410:"¡Ya está disponible WordPress 5.9.3!

His leadership helped the company remain independent of large hosting companies that have scooped up WordPress development tools of all kinds. Carnam described how the market has changed, forcing ServerPress&#8217; partners to make the difficult decision to close:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">\n<p>Earlier this year, one of the team members questioned whether or not DesktopServer v5.0 would have a viable market share. We had been so focused on building it out that throughout the development, we lost sight of constantly checking the temperature in the room.  Once we started discussing this we came to the conclusion that DS5’s potential market share has changed significantly over the last 10 years. The WordPress development tool landscape has grown and diversified greatly. This has diluted DesktopServer’s overall market share. The time, effort, and costs to bring in new users to DesktopServer’s workflow would be too much overhead for ServerPress to be sustainable. While many larger, well-funded companies would be able to absorb such costs involved, a company of our position cannot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>ServerPress did not communicate any plans for the future of its software products beyond the fact that they will no longer be supported. Longtime users and fans were disappointed to learn that the company is shutting down and some asked if they might consider making DesktopServer available to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am so gutted about <a href="https://twitter.com/DesktopServer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DesktopServer</a> shutting down.

Then I used <a href="https://serverpress.com/"><strong>Desktop Serv</strong>er</a>. I liked it and soon bought into a subscription. It was very host-agnostic and could be set up to push/pull to/from local and development sites. <strong>MAMP</strong> <a href="https://www.mamp.info/">remains a good choice</a> for this, but Desktop Server was the best for WordPress until about 2019. This past week <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnHooper/status/1554900277987360768">Desktop Server closed its doors</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever market share Desktop Server once had long ago went to &#8220;<strong><a href="https://localwp.com/">Local</a> by Flywheel</strong>,&#8221; which was the result of <a href="https://siliconprairienews.com/2016/12/flywheel-acquires-pressmatic/">their 2016 acquihire</a> of <strong>Clay Griffiths</strong> and <strong>Pressmatic</strong>. Pressmatic <a href="https://poststatus.com/notes/pressmatic-wants-new-standard-local-wordpress-development/">was first released that year</a> and cost $99 with no freemium pricing. Rebranded and rapidly developed for <strong>Mac</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, or <strong>Windows</strong>, Local was also completely free — for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>Connectability</strong> — Anyone should be able to connect to anyone else who wants their connection. This is the foundation for community and well exemplified in tools that are easy to take for granted, like email and Open Source projects like Matrix.&nbsp;</p><cite><a href="https://poststatus.com/open-web-manifesto/">The Open Web Manifesto</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-engine-acquires-flywheel/">WP Engine acquired Local</a> in 2019 along with <strong>Flywheel</strong>, and there was a brief period when <a href="https://localwp.com/pro-for-everyone/">a separate, subscription-based &#8220;Pro&#8221; version</a> was rolled out with essential developer features. That didn\'t last long, apparently due to the <a href="https://community.localwp.com/t/connect-to-any-host-that-offers-ssh-or-maybe-even-just-ftp-with-a-php-script-for-the-db/25792">user community reactions</a>, which focused heavily on the lack of host-agnostic support for syncing files and databases. Some features in Local still require additional subscription fees, but most users won\'t be crippled without them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local was already a raging success three years ago when WP Engine acquired it, and I am sure it has only grown in its userbase. Better integration with WP Engine\'s tools for headless sites, like <strong>Atlas</strong>, along with <strong>Migrate</strong> and other tools acquired from <strong>Delicious Brains</strong> will make Local an even more potent toolkit. Add <strong>Genesis</strong> and <a href="https://wpengine.com/blog/open-web-commitment-genesis/">where it\'s likely headed</a> with <strong>Full-Site Editing</strong> — see the work <strong>Mike McAlister</strong> has been doing on <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-engine-acquisition/">FSE Studio</a> — and you can imagine the end result being just about anything needed for WordPress site builds, from relatively simple brochureware to complex sites and headless installs. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I feel its time for a bump to this issue but the issue of Connect at large. Connect is a closed aspect of Local and we don’t seem to have any sort of mechanism or ability to add to or modify it ourselves, meaning we can’t even write our own extensions to Connect for other hosts and feel this needs to be addressed in totality not just adding a new connection to appease just a handful of users.&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://community.localwp.com/t/connect-to-siteground/25624/24">User dsnid3r on the Local Community Forum</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a short period of time where Local was <a href="https://localwp.com/pro-for-everyone/">re-released as a &#8220;Pro&#8221; subscription product</a> with the most useful basic features moved out of the free version. Due to the negative reactions that came in, the plug was quickly pulled on &#8220;Local Pro.&#8221; At that point, <a href="https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-makes-local-pro-free-for-all-users">it had 300,000 users</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local and newer developer tools in the WP Engine portfolio are all either free or reasonably priced freemium products. How well will any of them will work with other hosting platforms down the line is the question that might have otherwise happy Local users a little worried. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'d love it if Local\'s MagicSync worked with any host — including SpinupWP and InstaWP. In the past, there was some mention of Local\'s &#8220;Connect&#8221; feature potentially being open to other hosts, and <a href="https://community.localwp.com/c/feature-requests/connect-hosts/32">developer requests for this have never let up</a>. <a href="https://community.localwp.com/c/feature-requests/connect-hosts/32">That hasn\'t happened</a>.

Robert has <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/43039">opened an issue</a> for discussion in the Gutenberg <strong>GitHub</strong> repo that has a good quick summary of the vulnerability. It appears to be only a theoretical vulnerability. To exploit it, an attacker would need the ability to create content in WordPress along with other conditions. As Robert explains: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Gutenberg allows users to click &#8220;insert URL&#8221; and paste in a remote URL that points to an SVG file.

Jitendra found the vulnerability in his own pentesting and has shared all the details <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33994">on his blog</a>.

The long-awaited fluid typography support landed in this version. It provides smooth scaling between smaller and larger viewports, adapting in a fluid way to varying widths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Release lead George Mamadashvili demonstrated how this works in a video: </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Contrast that idea with font sizes that&nbsp;<em>respond</em>&nbsp;to specific viewport sizes, such as those defined by&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">media queries</a>, but do nothing in between those sizes,&#8221; Automattic developer Ramon Dodd said in the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39529">fluid type PR</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Theme.json already allows authors to insert their own fluid font size values. This won&#8217;t change, but this PR offers it to folks who don&#8217;t want to worry about the implementation details.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme developers who want to opt into fluid typography need only set <code>typography.fluid</code>&nbsp;to be&nbsp;<code>true</code> in theme.json and add <code>fluid</code> to each of the <code>settings.typography.fontSizes</code> with <code>min</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>max</code>&nbsp;values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Gutenberg contributors are requesting feedback from theme developers on this first iteration, as it is an experimental new feature. In the future, the feature may be configurable for users through the Global Styles UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The intention is to garner feedback on the formulae and API, before we think about any editor UI and, beyond that, introducing fluidity to other properties such as spacing,&#8221; Dodd said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors have already started updating to use the new fluid typography. Brian Gardner<a href="https://twitter.com/bgardner/status/1556636761228513283"> updated his Frost Theme</a> to use the feature, and Rich Tabor updated his Wei and Wabi&nbsp;themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As one of the bigger efforts towards making publishing beautifully rich pages in WordPress, fluid typography is a pretty big experience win for both the folks building with WordPress —&nbsp;and those consuming the content,&#8221; Tabor said in a tutorial on <a href="https://richtabor.com/fluid-typography-block-themes/">adding support for fluid typography in block themes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s also a part of making WordPress more powerful, while not more complicated (which we all know is quite the challenge).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 13.8 also includes a<a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/25892"> revamped Quote block</a> that is capable of nesting other blocks inside. Previously, the Quote block did not allow inner blocks, but users have often requested the ability to add lists or headings inside of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Quote block with nested blocks\n\n\n\n<p>Other user-facing improvements in 13.8 include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Template part UX improvements that make specific template part variations available in the block inserter</li><li>Border controls for image blocks</li><li>Post Comments and Comments blocks <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/41807">merged</a> into a single block – Comments</li><li>New <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42309">content size and wide size controls</a> in Global Styles, under &#8220;Layout&#8221; allows users to override content dimensions defined by a theme</li><li>Accessibility enhancements &#8211; improved and labels and tooltips across the editors, added more keyboard-friendly clickable elements in the “Add template” modal</li><li>New WhatsApp icon added to the Social Icon block</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This update erased performance gains from previous updates in both the post and site editor but future improvements may be able to chisel the times back into the range of previous benchmarks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the 13.8 <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/04/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-8-3-august/#fluid-typography-support">release post</a> for the full changelog and more details on all the enhancements and bug fixes.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 08 Aug 2022 20:28:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"Gutenberg Times: Layouts and Wide Alignments in WordPress: Then, Now, and Upcoming Changes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=21803";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"https://gutenbergtimes.com/layouts-and-wide-alignments-in-wordpress-then-now-and-upcoming-changes/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6232:"<p>For most of WordPress&#8217; history, the platform accepted a single layout width, defined by the active theme&#8217;s global <code>$content_width</code> variable. Theme authors were required to handle the CSS for it and any other sizes they wanted on output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When WordPress 5.0 launched the block editor, it introduced the concept of wide and full alignments (technically, they are &#8220;widths&#8221; or &#8220;sizes,&#8221; but let&#8217;s jump past this oddity of pigeon-holing sizing into the existing alignment system). Themes could add support via <code>add_theme_support( \'align-wide\' )</code> to allow users to select these additional widths for blocks, which would expand beyond the content area:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Full-width group with nested content with no width set in Twenty Twenty-One.\n\n\n\n<p>The solution was a groundbreaking first step. However, once again, theme authors were mostly left to figure out how this worked on their own. The flagship Twenty Twenty-One theme had dozens of lines of CSS to cover various scenarios to get it to work. WordPress had yet to include a standardized layout system at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to the WordPress 5.9 release in early 2022. The update added a global settings and styles feature, which included a layout system for handling wide sizes. Theme authors merely needed to define <code>settings.layout.contentSize</code> and <code>settings.layout.wideSize</code> in a <code>theme.json</code> file, as shown in the following code snippet:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="wp-block-code"><div><code class="hljs language-json shcb-code-table shcb-line-numbers shcb-wrap-lines"><span class="shcb-loc"><span>{\n</span></span><span class="shcb-loc"><span>        <span class="hljs-attr">"version"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span>,\n</span></span><span class="shcb-loc"><span>        <span class="hljs-attr">"settings"</span>: {\n</span></span><span class="shcb-loc"><span>                <span class="hljs-attr">"layout"</span>: {\n</span></span><span class="shcb-loc"><span>                        <span class="hljs-attr">"contentSize"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"38rem"</span>,\n</span></span><span class="shcb-loc"><span>                        <span class="hljs-attr">"wideSize"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"64rem"</span>\n</span></span><span class="shcb-loc"><span>                }\n</span></span><span class="shcb-loc"><span>	}\n</span></span><span class="shcb-loc"><span>}\n</span></span></code></div><small class="shcb-language" id="shcb-language-1"><span class="shcb-language__label">Code language:</span> <span class="shcb-language__name">JSON / JSON with Comments</span> <span class="shcb-language__paren">(</span><span class="shcb-language__slug">json</span><span class="shcb-language__paren">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>This meant that developers could remove most (all in some cases) of their custom CSS around content, wide, and full-width layouts. Compared to the previous default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two only had a handful of CSS workarounds for issues related to full-width alignments and root-level padding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new layout system came with new &#8220;rules&#8221; for aligning nested children of container-type blocks, such as Group. And, WordPress would only show the wide and full options if they were allowed. This caused some compatibility issues for classic theme adoption of <code>theme.json</code>, which we will get to. However, overall the system was finally coming together.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />A full-width group with nested content-width text and a wide image.\n\n\n\n<p>Users had a standard system that was cross-theme compatible (at least those with <code>theme.json</code> support), and theme authors only had to plug in a few configuration values.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Problem with Classic Theme Layout Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of WordPress&#8217; built-in layout system made for a lot less hassle coping with the multitude of page designs that users might attempt. It gave theme authors a much-needed standard that core could build atop in the future. However, the new system broke compatibility with some scenarios in classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For classic theme authors who adopted <code>theme.json</code>, they began <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33374">noticing two primary issues</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>When using a wide container block in classic themes, most themes defaulted to automatically showing nested blocks at the content width. However, in the new <code>theme.json</code>-based system, child blocks fill the width of their parent.</li><li>In classic, users could assign a wide/full width to any block, regardless of its container. The new system only supports wide/full alignments on children if the parent supports it, such as when the Group block sets nested blocks to inherit the default (content) width.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The default user experience changed and broke compatibility for classic themes that adopted <code>theme.json</code> after the WordPress 5.9 release. The mere existence of this file moves the user to the new layout system, regardless of whether <code>settings.layout</code> is explicitly set. Developers have no mechanism for opting out of it. This makes it a blocker for gradually adopting FSE components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, I recommend classic theme authors temporarily postpone adopting <code>theme.json</code> if they have an existing userbase. For new projects, adding support should be a non-issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is good news in store. First,  I (along with others) <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/392">updated the layout documentation</a> to provide a <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/theme-json/#layout">warning in the Theme Handbook</a> about this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a more permanent fix may be on the way. There is an open pull request to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42763">create a new content width layout type</a>. It would also make this the default setting for newly-created Group blocks, returning the user experience to the original behavior. There is no set-in-stone deadline for this, but I hope it lands in WordPress 6.1.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 07 Aug 2022 06:05:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:113:"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #71 – Gutenberg 13.8, Fluid Typography, updates to the  Block API and more";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=21815";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-71-fluid-typography-block-api/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64661:"<p>Grzegorz Ziolkowski subbed for Mary Job as co-host with Birgit Pauli-Haack.

In today&#8217;s episode, we&#8217;ll talk about Gutenberg 13.8 release updates to the block APIs, WordPress 6.1 planning, giving FSE a new name and so much more. I am Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate, and today my cohost is Grzegorz Ziolkowski, JavaScript developer and WebPress core contributor. Thank you so much, Grzegorz for subbing for Mary today. Mary sends her regards. She&#8217;s really inundated with work, which is good at one point, but we miss her today, and she will be again on the next episode. So how are you, Grzegorz? Thanks for joining us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Hello, Birgit. Hello, dear listeners. I&#8217;m great. So happy to join you again and talk about everything related to Gutenberg, which is always fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and we are so glad to have you. You will bring&#8230; We will talk about some block APIs because there are big changes coming. Can you let us in or should we wait &#8217;til we get through the release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh yeah. Like there are a lot of things going on. We are trying to better organize the roadmap for more technical aspects of Gutenberg. So that was one of the talking points during WordCamp Europe. Many core contributors brought that. It&#8217;s like the roadmap for user facing features is pretty well defined. You have a lot of references for that, but sometimes, like with so many open issues, it&#8217;s really hard to find what&#8217;s the most important bits on the technical level and how we can improve building blocks for core and for all extenders, how we can better integrate customizing blocks to work better with blog patterns and with teams in general. So this is what we are trying address with that and we can cover that at the end of the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And just wanted to tease it out so people stay on beyond the Gutenberg Changelog for the last Plugin release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we head into that, there are a few things that happen on the team. One is the WordPress 6.1 planning is done. We have a preliminary schedule and the post also contains a full slate of release leads. So the Feature-Freeze and Beta I for 6.1 is September 20th, and that brings us with Gutenberg up to the version 14.1 if the team keeps the two-week release cycle. There&#8217;s no reason why it wouldn&#8217;t. And then a release Candidate I would be October 11. That&#8217;s when all the Field Guide is going to be published and now more any string, it&#8217;s also hard string freeze so that the translators are able to kind of continue the work. And then the final release is November 1st. That moved from the preliminary schedule that was published four weeks ago or something like that, but with the comments from that planning, it didn&#8217;t have a third Beta release, but that is now on the schedule and that pushed the final release date a week into November 1st.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release squad is release leaders, Matt Mullenweg with the release candidate coordinators again with Hector Prieto and Jonathan Derosia, two veterans leading the release, coordinate the release. And then core-tech co-leads, sorry, is Mike Schroeder, David Bombard and Jeff Paul. And editor tech co-leads, Michael Chaplinsky and Bernie Reider. And then core triage co-leads is Jean-Baptiste Audras and Ahmad Jayon. And editor triage co-leads are Nick Diego and Anne McCarthy. Documentation co-leads is Milana Kapp and Femi Pressid, and yours truly again. So now I&#8217;m not a rookie anymore and it&#8217;s good to do two releases in a row, because first you learn a lot and the second one you can actually really contribute and not be a pain in the whatnot with all the questions. Marketing and communications lead is Jonathan Pantanni. Test lead is Brian Alexander and Ana Lakisik, and design lead is Rich Tabor. So this is a great squad, again, for the 6.1 release. That&#8217;s the third release in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I think the squad is excellent. We have a lot of people that were involved in the previous release and also in the release from many months ago, so that&#8217;s always a good mix of people. And I guess you did excellent in the 6.0, Birgit, so you are too humble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, we also have something new on the release lead. Femi Pressid, she&#8217;s new to the release cycle, but she has been working on the Gutenberg end user documentation for about a year now and has done an excellent job keeping up with all of it. And now being on the Release co-lead for documentation means the end user documentation gets a lot more weight and she also can start earlier to triage what will be in the Release and what is user facing to update the documentation. If it&#8217;s not before the release, then it&#8217;s very close after the Release. So we give her all the support that she can get and if you, dear listeners, are inclined to do some writing and want to do some updates on the end user documentation, because you do it for your clients anyway, or you are, you always wanted to start contributing to the documentation team. Don&#8217;t hesitate to come and either ping me or ping Femi or Milana that you want to contribute. And believe me, we will put you to work, so you can definitely make a great difference on the documentation team for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes. It&#8217;s also the last release of the year, which means that there should be a new default team. I don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s going to be handled this year, because with block teams, there are so many options. You can use block team variations or type variations. There&#8217;s many options like block patterns. So I have no idea how the design team is go going to sort that out. I know that Rich Tabor as a team lead, that&#8217;s an excellent choice. He has a lot of teams in the repository. I mean, in the directory, so you can check them out, look buy out or name and see what he&#8217;s capable of. So that&#8217;s going to be very interesting. And I also am really excited that the blog editor triage leads, this idea is continued. It was a last minute edition for 6.0 and Nick Diego, he did excellent job helping Core editor Dech Letes with picking the right back fixes and improvements, enhancements, and stuff like that during the holiday. So now having him and Anne McCarty that should be a dream team to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I totally agree with that. He and George Mamadashvili, who also was release lead for this latest Gutenberg Plugin release, they do actually weekly triage meetings now in the Core editor channel and they started that, I think about a month ago. And this has been quite helpful because they sometimes close issues or can push some of the PRs further and see if it gets to a solution quicker. We also have, thank you for pointing out the proposal or mentioning the new default theme. If you missed that, there is a proposal for a new kind of default theme. What was that name? Man, Jenny Ritter. She posted that about two weeks ago and it&#8217;s more like it&#8217;s going to be a base theme, but then it&#8217;s a call for the community to send in style variations as well as for that theme that then totally can change how a site looks, even if it doesn&#8217;t change the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s an excellent new approach using all the different tools that are available, especially the style variations. I find that very&#8230; And Rich Tabor also has, he&#8217;s not on the team for the default team, but he&#8217;s definitely raised his hand to say, &#8220;Well, I will contribute some style variation for the default theme.&#8221; And please, we will share the post in the show notes, of course so you can share your feedback. That&#8217;s one thing, but also you can be updated on the next version of this, because the next iteration will be that there will be a basic theme and then how to submit style variations that hasn&#8217;t been yet finalized. How the process going to work, it&#8217;s always with the new things. You need to find the right process to make it work, but Jenny Ritter and the design team and the theme team are working closely together to make this a great new default theme experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. So we have one more news to share. So because the date for the WordPress 6.1 is so far ahead, we are also preparing a bug fix release for WordPress major version, which is going to be 6.0.2. And we still didn&#8217;t decide on the exact dates, but we are shooting at the end of month and you should expect some official announcements soon, probably after The core chat that happens every Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that is good. That&#8217;s good. There are a few bug fixes that came out and having them fixed sooner rather than later is really good. Thanks for pointing that out, Grzegorz. We also have a link to the design explorations that James Koster did and he published it on the Design Team post, and that is a new way to offer editor configuration to new people who encounter the blog editor for the first time to select on their, the placement of their toolbar and has some little jiffs in there that actually shows the user, what does it mean? One is the toolbar, the other one, and then the document tool being on top, and then the block toolbar, as well as the accessibility. Like you want to see only the icons or also the text for the buttons in the toolbar and similar things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s very interesting. It makes the model, the grading model a little larger, but it actually conveys so much more information and it&#8217;s so much more helpful I find than the current user experience. So take a look at it. Right now, these are explorations. There&#8217;s nothing decided on yet, but that&#8217;s the right moment to offer your opinions and offer suggestions and ideas and be part of the process. So we will share that link in the show notes, of course, and it&#8217;s called &#8220;Design exploration, encourage editor configuration during onboarding.&#8221; So Ben Dwyer just merged a prototype to merge blog CSS with the theme JSON Styles. And that definitely is something that theme developers should take a look at to see if that works with how they want to approach it or with their themes. It&#8217;s in combination with a new post that says, &#8220;Moving core blog styling to JSON.&#8221; And that&#8217;s certainly something that is ahead of 6.1 to figure out, to make the process of, to give more customization optimizations options through the global styles UI, and that themes can override block JSON styles as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s going to be interesting to see how that is received by the design and theme developers, as well as the Plug-in developers. Do you have any thoughts on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, so like we are training in the very interesting situation because, so far team could have opinions about styles, like default styles for blogs, and that&#8217;s like something that can scale well, but sometimes, because we have this interface that unifies how you deal with so many aspects of how blogs look like. So you can change spacing, padding, fonts, and all the types, all that everything created to typography. You can change background color, foreground color, links, and so many things that we constantly see new things arriving. And that&#8217;s like in the past, you would customize that for the individual blogs using CSS. But now the same styles can be replaced by the same construct that exists for themes in the theme JSON file. So like the idea is how to leverage that also on the blog level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it brings a lot of power because you can use one language to change everything, but then it creates a lot of questions, like what comes first? Which one should be applied on top of another one? And there&#8217;s also a similar exploration for Plugins. So there&#8217;s Plugins that change a lot of things. For instance, WooCommerce comes and they can have opinions about styles for blocks as well. So they also trying to find a way using the same representation in the JSON file. So you could combine them together. And it&#8217;s definitely very powerful. The benefit of using this common language to express styles is that you can use all type of tools that we see popping up in the community. There is a few tools that allow you to generate those theme JSON files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that could be extended for in the future for block JSON. And for maybe, I don&#8217;t know, what&#8217;s going to be for Plugins, maybe a theme JSON, but maybe Plugin JSON. Time will tell, but it&#8217;s about having programmatic control over all those things and having a coherent way to change the same aspects of the front, on the front end how everything looks like. And some people describe that this is how the design system gets introduced to WordPress which is like a good change from the design perspective. But it&#8217;s a very complex to come up with a good approach. So that&#8217;s why we have this proposal, the call for feedback. So people can share their ideas and their concerns, how that might evolve, how that might impact their projects and products and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yeah, it&#8217;s going to be&#8230; It&#8217;s some interesting times, especially as you said, kind of the roadmap for, at the beginning for UI and for the no code users is pretty much well spelled out and there&#8217;s a vision, but now that it&#8217;s almost done with the underlying architecture, there are now the things that need to be happening for extenders, for plugin developers, theme developers. And because everything is now at least understood how it&#8217;s in place, there are still a few things like the style engine and this, the common language of how blogs are styled that are coming together. And yeah, these are exciting times. I love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the community, so Josepha Haden Chomphosy, executive director of the WordPress open source project has posted a post with a headline, &#8220;Giving FSE a more user friendly name.&#8221; And the TLDR for it is that the terms full site editing or full site editor also abbreviated FSE were actually just a code name internally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they were developed to easily refer to all the collection of features under, that are for site editing and global styles and that. And I integrate in the WordPress experience, but how can we best update the wording to be more user friendly? Because it doesn&#8217;t tell the user anything. And naming is really hard. We see that all the time. There are few issues that she has with it, or sees with it that it&#8217;s already possible to edit every part on WordPress using code. So the term for that editing doesn&#8217;t differentiate between the phases of the project and does not show the new capabilities of the CMS per se. And it also implies the use of blocks, but for new users, there&#8217;s no reason for them to expect anything else. So the term isn&#8217;t descriptive enough for a user that comes to WordPress, what does it do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then she goes in a little bit more detail and asked then a few questions for you. We&#8217;ve referred to it this way for a long time is one of the reasons how can we tackle renaming it together? And then it&#8217;s in the code base. So how will we make sure people who aren&#8217;t regular contributors see that there will be a change and repeating in line? What other context do you think we need to be aware to look at when we refer to the collective work in the future? So this is one of the more discussed posts. But your opinion is definitely worth bringing in. There are 88 replies already, but I don&#8217;t think that a lot of people have seen that yet. So if you haven&#8217;t read it yet, and haven&#8217;t thought about that, it&#8217;s definitely worth your attention, unless you say, &#8220;Okay, well, I don&#8217;t know how, what they call it. I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, but yeah, most of the time, if you are an educator, if you are a theme developer, you have to talk to your users and just explain what it is. This is what we call full set editing now. And there might be a better way and there should be a better way, I think. So that&#8217;s one of the pieces I have for you and the other one&#8230; So there was a call for testing out from the FSE program, the 15th in a row. And Anne had a deadline of August 1st for comments. I think it ran for four weeks and she now published the summary post for it. And yeah, it was amazing. There were two translations again for the Japanese community, as well as for the Italian community. So there were other voices heard while speaking of translation. Yeah, full site editing doesn&#8217;t translate well into a lot of languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there was also a concern. And then she also used for the first time for a test release, a feature or a service called Insta WP, which lets her set up a site and give you a link to it, so you can spin up your own test website without having to do a local install or any of that. So you could use it for seven days to go through the test. That was really interesting. So the high level summary is there&#8217;s still a lot of confusion about certain things, especially it was heavy on the Query Loop, but it was also when you create a new template, you get an empty view. Is there a way to make it replicate some of the footers and headers that is on other templates also for a new one. So they know, okay, this is what I have on every website and something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So to clarify, what was the text as exactly. I read that you were asked to go to the editor, like full site editor, just to make a pun of the name and then go to the toolbar and probably create a new template and pick a category, like version of the template and then like go and like use Query Loop to display all the posts from that category and provide everything else that you want to see on this type of pages. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Right. And that was one task. And the other task was to create new posts, to explore patterns that were already available on the site. That&#8217;s why the Insta WP was an important, that a pattern for a new event announcement and a pattern for an event recap, meaning there were also additional information that we&#8217;re supposed to be in there in the pattern and how it worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. But still, this is very exciting that you can go and create a template using your browser without having any access to the server and like, you know it&#8217;s just like, it&#8217;s a so huge change for site owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. And up until those changes were in the block editor, it was always more like a catch up for what has been around in page builders for maybe a decade or something like, well, no, no six or seven years apart, that was not in core. But now with this new template editor, this is something that you couldn&#8217;t do before without code. That you have an author template and the in 13.7. There were a whole range of new templates available now. And in this version we have, yet another one and that is probably the conclusion of, how many different template types can we create. Yeah, I&#8217;m really excited about that. That&#8217;s a total new thing for site owners that don&#8217;t need any developer to not only have a new template, but also can create the pattern creation that is still the missing link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can do a combination of having for every new user on your site that edits, you could as a developer, you can actually have patterns for a certain blog type or post type show up in the create new methods. So that is also something that is highly underused right now. I think those things all come together with time and we need to really have more educational posts around that, like the call for testing. That&#8217;s the best way to learn what the new features are when you follow those calls for testing, because they&#8217;re very detailed and very distinct and make sure that you can accomplish that, but you learn so much. All right. Yeah, that brings us to what&#8217;s released?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I mean, finally, there is a lot of cover that&#8217;s happening in the community. That&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So Gutenberg 13.8, it was released. George Mamadashvili, was a release lead and he noted that we are almost really 3 releases away from 6.1. I did some calculations and it seems that 14.1 will be the last Plugin release that will make it into 6.1. And that is supposed to come out on September 17, something like that. Yeah. So 13.8 comes with fluid typography, accessibility improvements, revamped quote blog template parts, UX enhancements. And it&#8217;s also of course always full of bug fixes and code quality improvements. So let&#8217;s take it from the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. So the flow typographic is a huge change. It&#8217;s something that probably a lot of designers expected to see and, it&#8217;s something that still isn&#8217;t exposed in the UI. So we need to wait for that. It&#8217;s a pretty common approach that we seen in the past. And we talk about the other future that our first available through code and then the UI comes after, after it&#8217;s properly tested. So maybe Birgit will tell more about what&#8217;s exciting about this feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, the fluid topography, what that does is that you can, as a theme developer set a minimum size of your font sizes for the smaller screen and the maximum size for the big, big, big screens. And then what the theme does is, or WordPress does is kind of scales from the small to the screen, seamlessly the typography. So the size of the letters, the spacing of the letters, and also how the paragraphs kind of form. So there is no set viewpoint or view port for the mobile version or the tablet version. It is seamless. And that is kind of the approach that the Gutenberg developers have taken to more implement intrinsic design rather than the certain viewpoints that are along the way, which other page builders have. It&#8217;s now available in theme JSON and the fourth theme JSON. So you need to, can set it in the theme JSON file and then how to implement that is in the PR that&#8217;s 39529.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know there is a certain, a post in the works to flash that out a bit for the theme developers and it&#8217;s coming out in the next week or two, but in the PR which we will separately share in the show notes, you are able to set the settings dot typography dot font sizes, and then give it presets for your theme. You set the fluid field to true, and then you have the minimum size and the maximum size, or you can name them. And your theme then is able to, and WordPress will create the variables for it, for the units. It seems that the best use would be to use the REM units for the relative size propagation. Right now the maximum view port is 1600 pixels. And yeah, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s right, that it says here 768 for the smaller size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it will not go all the way down to the mobile, but this is the first version. So it&#8217;s not going to be perfect and it&#8217;s going to be, it&#8217;s really going to be rough. So the developers really need you to test it out and give some feedback on it, how your implementation is either stifled or what are the blockers? What does work, what does not work. How you would kind of proceed with that, because as Grzegorz said, the first version is just to get it out in front of the people to be testing and then iterate on the implementation with the feedback from the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Although I must say that all the demos I&#8217;ve seen so far look pretty great. Maybe it isn&#8217;t like so rough, as you mentioned, maybe it&#8217;s like good enough for some themes to enable that and see how it plays in practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. I certainly have a &#8220;it&#8217;s good enough kind of approach to many, many things.&#8221; But I know that separates me from the professional theme developers and designers. They want it to be pixel perfect. And they want it to be very granular, have flexibility, very granular form. So I think I would not be a good judge of the feature because I also don&#8217;t make a living selling themes. So I really would love to see what Anna Sekoda for instance does with it, or what Ellen Bauer who is also, has been a theme developer since the beginning of blocks and FSE. And they have already published quite a few like Rich Tabor, quite a few themes in the theme directory or also on the WooCommerce marketplace. So that is definitely something they will test it out and figure out what&#8217;s needs to be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So other enhancements that we have in the 13.8 release is that the social icon block has a variation now or an icon for the WhatsApp app, has a WhatsApp icon. So you can also connect your profile, your WhatsApp profile on your website. What I also am quite excited about is actually talking about theme JSON, that quite a few things in this release that are concerning the theme JSON on file. This one is also support for heading and caption elements in the theme JSON schema, meaning that you can target with your CSS directly, the HTML elements without having to create another class name or something with your styling. One is also a little minor. That&#8217;s the merge of comments and post comments blocks. That&#8217;s a big deal, but it&#8217;s also kind of the merging of the old thing with a new thing. So when you use the old comments block and now use the new post comments block, it will update your comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s mostly before the themes that use the old block. So right now, if you use that, it&#8217;ll migrate to the new one, but it will still retain the old behavior. And you will be able to switch to the version with blocks, which like within the blocks, which is like more powerful in terms of all the types of customization that users can do inside the editor in WordPress. Whereas the old one, it depends on templates that are PHP based. And in like by fault, it uses what every WordPress instance provides that can be written by teams, but every site could also provide their own. But you need to code that so that the new version is what we would prefer, because with the block concept, you can do more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So another great feature is now added to the image block and that is border support for color, width and style. And I think that&#8217;s the last piece missing to make it really flexible what you do with themes. And George wrote that he&#8217;s very curious to see what the creative folks at the museum for block art can accomplish with that, because now you can actually change the border width and differently from the right and left on top and bottom, and then change the color of each. And it&#8217;s very flexible and you also can change the radius of the border. So you have round a corner on two sides and square corners on the other side. And it&#8217;s just really amazing what you can do with it when you have border controls. So yeah, definitely check it out and see what you want to do with it. The block museum for block art is definitely open for submissions. And I will share in the show notes, how you can submit your creations and see what you can come up with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, there were also a couple of changes to template parts, which makes them even more powerful. The one thing that I like a lot is that right now it was quite difficult to explore existing template parts in the inserter because they were hidden and you had to insert the template part and you&#8217;d, once the block was in the editor canvas you had two options. One was, set existing template part, the other one, you could create it from the scratch. So right now all the existing template parts are also exposing the inserter, which is like a shortcut for everyone. It&#8217;s easier to find them, which is a good change. It also aligns more with how usable blocks work, which are in their own tab in this inserter here. Like those template parts, as far as I remember, there are inside blocks, which is like, might be a little bit confusing, so maybe that&#8217;s something that could be iterated full there. However, if you search, you don&#8217;t care so much and you will be able to see them. So I find it like a great step in their right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting how people explore interfaces completely differently. So having multiple ways to do the same thing, really exposes more users to the intuition on how to change things and streamlining the process, like these shortcuts is definitely a way to go. Yay. There is a minor change to the color palette. It now displays of checkout preview background and the value is transparent. So you couldn&#8217;t see from the color settings, if there is a transparent color or transparent background on a group blog or on a cover block, now you can see it through the checkout preview. That&#8217;s definitely a quality of life kind of change that your brain really can absorb that and see that there and give you the signal. There&#8217;s a transparent value there. You can now also, and that was missing for a while, you could do the layout content size settings through the theme JSON, but the user didn&#8217;t have any way to correct that or change that. Now a site owner has. You can now do it through the interface that you can set the content with as well as the wide width and also the padding for, for those blocks. So that is really for the layout of the template, so that has…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: There&#8217;s one change that I&#8217;m pretty excited about. It&#8217;s about the placement of the inline toolbar when using feature text tools like bold italic underlying. So at the moment, like in the past, like in most cases you would see that in the block toolbar that could be either dock to the header or on the top of your block, especially when you write a longer paragraph is like is far away when you want to use a mouse to interact with that. So now you can change the setting and that will be like a floating toolbar that&#8217;s always next to the text that you have highlighted, which is very similar to what you will see on mobile devices or tablets when you interact with the apps that come with the system, like iOS or Android. So I like that one. And I&#8217;m hoping that people find useful as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I really like that. I saw that first in medium, when they came out that they had this, you highlight a text and then they offered you a formatting toolbar. And I really loved that. And I was missing that in Gutenberg forever, obviously. But I also tested the distraction free writing tool that Rich Tabor and Jeffrey Carandang created that was the iceberg editor. And they actually implemented that as well. And I&#8217;m glad that it now came to core and that we have the first iteration of that. And I&#8217;m eager to test it out and use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Also from the experience, I know it&#8217;s a bit tricky to use that feature, especially when you are using mobile devices because their system provides their own toolbar. So if in that context, it might be very disruptive, because you don&#8217;t know whether that toolbar will come from the system or from the block editor. So, not all features might be available if you see the system one. So, it&#8217;s something that needs to still to be tested, but because it&#8217;s a setting you can for the mobile, you can disable that. And for the browsers, you can have it enabled. So I&#8217;m sure that we all see some improvements on that front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent, yes. And a whole new, so the quote has received a total revamp, so to speak the quote block, now you can use it and it&#8217;s coming out of experimentation with this 13.8 version. So it gets quite a few more testing in before it actually will come to 6.1. Now you can use nested blocks with your quote block. So you could have a quote from someone and add an image to it, or have multiple paragraphs in there, or have a list in a quote block. Often, you couldn&#8217;t do a list and make it a quote. So now you can, and I&#8217;m really happy that it made it into this version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s very powerful, especially for developers who use GitHub and they know what you can do using markdown that you often quote something which includes code examples, images, videos, and so on. So like this is like bringing the same functionality into the block ward. So I&#8217;m really excited about that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, especially when you have code quotes and tutorials also. Yeah, it definitely helps to have that, also have the citation with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> And also there&#8217;s ongoing work to bring the same set of features for the list block, which is another level of complexity. So now you would be able to have a quote that has a list that has inside that nester blocks, you can have paragraphs headings and code examples, even in list, which you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Icon, emojis. Emojis in a list block. Yes. Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: These are much more complex because they&#8217;re like, at least are not two dimensional and it&#8217;s not only like the nest of blocks can be on one level, but you can have, the list itself can have a nest at least. So it&#8217;s like the interactions between those internal, nested blocks are much more complex. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s going to be ready for 6.1, but it&#8217;s definitely in works and might happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And if you are very interested in that list version two, list block version two is still in experiments. So you need to enable it through the experiment settings before you can test it out in your local or test site. I wouldn&#8217;t do it in production, but yeah, for testing, it&#8217;s definitely, you need to enable it in the experiment settings. Yeah, I&#8217;m really looking forward to that, especially because you&#8217;re not, so when you change from a bullet list to an ordered list, you change the whole mockup in it. So what happens then? There are quite some complexities there. We have seen that in discussions also with the table of contents block that comes out of the gate with a numbered list. But many people don&#8217;t like the numbered list and there is no way to change it over to a bulleted list. Say maybe the experiences that come with the list development with the list block version two can actually be replicated for other great blocks that are out there. So what else is in there? So anything that stood out for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I think we covered the most important aspects, like enhancements and new features. That&#8217;s quite a huge list. There are some accessibility improvements as usual. It&#8217;s always great to see contributors focus on that area, which is like never good enough because the interactions in the editor are so complex. That is very hard to do it right on field first run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There have been changes to the border controls, which are trigger quite some creativity. So getting that right for accessibility, with labeling and tool tips and field sets and legends that is now available in the Plugin. And then there were some fixes for descriptions or for some other labeling and semantics in the paragraph block. And then also to, they also replace some diff elements, clickable diff elements with actually buttons because that&#8217;s a better experience for all users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: There&#8217;s also, like in that, related to that, there&#8217;s a very interesting change now. When you are focused on the group block, you can use, enter key to create a new empty paragraph just after the group block. So before you would just like, it wouldn&#8217;t like, nothing would happen. So you would have to use maybe the drop down menu from the toolbar for the block to find insert a block after the group, or maybe like find some other way, like in between line easier there with mouse. Now it&#8217;s much more convenient just to press enter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I always appreciated that with, for instance, the list block where you can enter, enter, and then you&#8217;re out of the list block and can start. But getting that to more than one blocks is really good. There are also some big change, not big, but yeah good changes in the documentation of things, especially, having many more examples in the core blocks, a data API on how you use it. And some of the examples are also with great comments, so you can make more sense out of things. I think that Ryan Welcher does the great work there and he definitely can use some help. He is determined to have for every function call or store call or something like that. He has an example that is ready to copy paste into some other code, or at least with adaptions. The docs for the block JSON are also updated because it was missing the block variations. And that has been added to the JSON schema definition so now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can point to the block variations as well as to the styles with your block metadata. And then the data module had some missing references and that have been updated. So you can actually find them in the documentation now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, theme JSON got some clarifications on the null true and false values for the block gap setting. That was a little confusing before. So it&#8217;s now straight net, as I would say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s ongoing effort to improve developer documentation. There is a lot of public APIs that are documented, but they miss examples. And I think that the work that Ryan Welcher is shepherding is so important to get it because like having code examples makes it so much easier to actually use the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah, totally agree with that. So I think we are at the end of the Changelog for the 13.8 Plugin release that happened this week on our third.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we come to the section, what&#8217;s an active development and what&#8217;s discussed. And before we head into the block API issues, I think there was one thing that I wanted to point out and that is that Ramon published an update also on the style engine tracking issue. So we will definitely point to that in the show notes, but he has, so the style engine is at an experimentation, right or is in experimentation right now. So, but it has a phase one which is block supports and building the foundation. And then the phase two is the global styles consolidation, reducing style tags. And in both, he has some updates on some of the issues. So make sure if you&#8217;re theme developer, you&#8217;re definitely interested in what&#8217;s coming down with the style engine development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s very related to what we are going to cover now, which is block API. So style engine is in fact, subset of that, it&#8217;s related to how class names and style attributes are added to the block HTML output. And the idea we style engine is that eventually we would have everything generated on the server only on the front end, so that means that only styles and class names would be included on the page when the given block is there, which means an excellent reduction of unused CSS, which a lot of websites struggle with today and the progress on that is really promising. And I hope that in a few months we will see all the benefits of the work happening on that front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. So you revamped some of the&#8230; You created a tracking issue for the block API that had quite a few chapters on it and does seem to only have 35 tasks and there are other tracking issues with much longer, but it covers issues that are around block assets, block registration, block attributes, variations, block supports, and then the inserting and moving blocks and block editing, dynamic block manipulation, server side rendering component and of course documentation. So what stands out for you on this? What is the big effort here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So first of all, we have over 4,000 issues open in the Gutenberg repository. You know it&#8217;s very hard to triage all of them, go back and see what&#8217;s there. So the effort that I made together with Matias just was, can we identify the most common, occurring issue that people rise and they want to see improved and that we wanted to collect items that make the biggest impact in the short term. And it&#8217;s not like the list is close. We will be constantly revisiting whether the list makes sense. We will be adding new features based on the feedback from people in general. It&#8217;s just a way for us to bring better focus on what we can work on in the upcoming WordPress releases and Gutenberg releases and, like it&#8217;s dividing the sections, just like it tries to follow how the milestones for how the WordPress, the block editors and the full site editing should evolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always like milestone for template parts, milestone for global styles and so on. We try to mirror the same structure. And for now it&#8217;s because issues that we&#8217;ve been talking about, some of them for years now, and there were never clear focus to work on them. And we are trying to change that because we see that stuff like block validation and block deportation comes back every now and then, this people often complain about. So we just want to make sure that there is single place that people can go and see, &#8220;Okay, is that on the roadmap? Is that being tracked? How can I get involved and help move that forward?&#8221; So instead of saying that, find the issue on GitHub throughout all those 4,000 issues. Like there&#8217;s a single place. It&#8217;s pinned when you go to the Gutenberg repository and you go to issues like on the top of the page, there are three pinned issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s one of them now. So it&#8217;s easy to find for people if they know about that thing. And so it&#8217;s easier to discover and this is also a good way to see what&#8217;s actually being worked on because if you go to this issue and the tracking number is 41236, you can see because there is an icon is a ranch or how you call it like that like…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, toolbox tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Toolbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Tool set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Toolbox, tool set. So you can see this icon. It means that someone is actually working on this feature or there is open PR, so you can leave your feedback there. And once we have some issues done, then we just be marked as finished. So people can see at some point a history of the progress what&#8217;s being worked there. It&#8217;s also a nice way if someone opens a new issue and you know, like Fabian Kagy, he opened recently some issues related to how we could better control inserting blocks in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you could define, for instance, this blog goes only when there is no block inside the template, or maybe I want to have only a single instance of this block when it is inside a given parent block, like very complex use cases and those type of issue, they&#8217;re great ideas, but it&#8217;s not so easy to define how that could be done. So this tracking issue will try to combine similar issues like that and put that into the tracking issue. So you can have a single reference and find those issues also from the perspective of project management, like when someone opens a new issue and we can easily say, &#8220;Okay, please check this tracking issue and see what we already have on this topic and see how that fits to the proposed solutions so far.&#8221; Like this type of capabilities are open and I mean, I&#8217;m really excited about that because so far it was really hard to identify how people can get involved to improve the API blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it impacts how you develop blocks and to make it easier, more straightforward for all the developers. But also it impacts the core blocks. Everyone would benefit from the ideas that are in short in decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, let&#8217;s see at some of the examples and so in the assets there isn&#8217;t one tasks to explore how to tree shake block styles on the front end and has an example issue and that is how, what does it mean? That&#8217;s kind of how the CSS cascades through the front end. Another one is combined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. So the idea here is for instance, the idea was whether we can find a way to define, okay, this style is present on the page when the following conditions happen. For instance, in the block has a special class name called, whatever. And then the system that would be built behind that could say, &#8220;Okay, and this blog doesn&#8217;t have this class. That means that we can skip that and we don&#8217;t have to serve it to the user.&#8221; So it&#8217;s fairly technical, but that gives you idea what exciting things we can do with blocks, having better understanding of how they are structured, what they contain and like these ideas. Also, there&#8217;s a lot of requests from Plugin outdoors. So they would like to have a better ways to inject their own styles to blocks or JavaScripts. So, we are discussing different ways how it to make it easier so you could just define okay to all blogs that met certain criteria, let&#8217;s add this style that brings some additional visual effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I understand that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: One of the things that we are actively working on is related to dynamic block manipulation. So we always wanted to have a way to, let&#8217;s say, use some data that comes from database or some external service. So for instance, the ideas are the simplest one, you have a block inside the footer that shows a copyright note, like in PHP it&#8217;s easy because you are using date function and just like changes every year. So you don&#8217;t have to go to your website and update that. And how to define some, some ways. So you could just insert a token that says, &#8220;Okay, this is a date.&#8221; And it displays a year and it will change automatically inside the block. So it&#8217;s shortening the database, something dynamic, on the render of the front end it changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this is very advanced concept. And however we are now, we should see next week a proposal on make core block for something more simple. Often people want to replace some text or token or something, the credit that like a pattern inside your block. For instance, the cover block has a featured image and it&#8217;s really powerful. And we&#8217;ll be seeing a proposal for special API that will make that simpler so you can define like, let&#8217;s find this stack and change this attribute source with the value that comes from the featured image and this type of thing. So everything is very technical. And I think that is a good common, like good place for people who are very familiar with JavaScript, but also with PHP. So like everyone finds something to think about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, especially the inline token. We actually had Danny Schnell as a guest on our podcast here when he was working and trying to think through that. And he took us quite deeply into what needs to happen. And so make it complex, make it easy, make it simple. And we call it back then, we call it kind of the short codes 2.0, so it&#8217;s not nothing new to WordPress, but it&#8217;s the innovative version, the better blocks version for it to have these inline tokens for replacing some variable with something else or with some values. And I&#8217;m glad that you said that&#8217;s kind of in the works for next week to try out or to at least kick it around in theory, so that&#8217;s wonderful. There&#8217;s also something that&#8217;s in the works that&#8217;s…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> And for block registration, there is like a very quite simple proposal. Like right now to define how the dynamic block gets rendered with PHP you need to like define a function. Inside this function you will get some, like content of the block attributes and the block type, and use all those variables to generate the output that&#8217;s going to be displayed on the front end. And we are also thinking ahead and trying to combine efforts with how in the future you could like to write simpler blocks in that you would provide a PHP template that generates that output instead. So you don&#8217;t have to deal with functions. You just provide a function that just prints everything. And this proposal covers that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That sounds really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So in the future, we could have something similar for JavaScript. So also you could provide like, depends would we peak and land on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, but there is this in the WordPress like organization on GitHub, there is block hydration, experiments, repository, and like explores exactly what I said for JavaScript, how to make blocks interactive on the front end. So for instance, they can have buttons that change state of the block, and you can have like dynamic data that updates, for instance the simple example, people always use the counter. Like you click the plus sign and the number changes, so this type of features. And at some point we hope that this PHP template and JavaScript template could be somehow unified. So maybe not in a sense that you would be writing a single code, but with some tooling, maybe we could have some format that allows you to generate PHP and JavaScript. So you don&#8217;t have to bother and write it twice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that was a big discussion between Helen Busandy and Mark Jakeworth and Riad Benguela about, I think it was in October last year. And then I know Michael Chaplinsky has done some more exploration. And then there was, did you work with Ellen Cherser on the, there is a new JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowsk</em>i: Bento?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Bento. Yeah, Bento JavaScript. Kind of replace the JavaScript framework with a different framework. It&#8217;s not certainly the best approach, but if it works for people who use that. Before that you can use it for blocks with different languages or languages and variations and frameworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: In some ways the Bento components that Google is working on are similar to the ideas because it just exactly does that. So they have some way to define components and they have different representation for web components for PreAct and you can just, it&#8217;s the same UI, but you can use different code, depending whatever you want to have on your website. And it sort of falls in the same category. But it&#8217;s just like Bento is done by Google. And it&#8217;s hard to tell how it evolves. So we are exploring different parts for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. No, I get it. Well, so is there anything else then, do you want to point out from this tracking issue or discussion?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I guess I&#8217;m good. One of the ideas that Fabian mentioned is very interesting, so because the way to control where you display blocks has always been troublesome for people. So people want to have flexibility. For instance, you have custom post type, you don&#8217;t want to see all blocks, so how to do that. And we have some ways on the server you can provide allowed blocks to which is list of types of blocks that are allowed. But sometimes we want to have the positive approach. How do I say that? Which blocks I don&#8217;t want, and I want the rest. So that&#8217;s also some of the discussions happening that the people like our listeners could chime in and share their ideas. And in general, with WordPress 6.0, we added our sister Field, which allows you to define, &#8220;Okay, I want to have this block when one of the parent or grandparent or grand grandparent blocks are this and that block.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s gives more flexibility, like the comments lock uses that because it allows you have comments and you can have group, then you can have, I don&#8217;t know, what else do you want? You can have several groups and then you use a common title, for instance, I mean, in small complex, but make it shorter. And this gives a lot of flexibility and one of the ideas I had originally, how you say like, &#8220;I want to have this parent and this ancestor, but I don&#8217;t want to have this ancestor.&#8221; This type of way of defining, which would satisfy a lot of use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, indeed. And I think we need to really write much more use cases for it, and tutorials so people can actually imagine things here because theoretically, what&#8217;s an ancestor? What&#8217;s a parent, what&#8217;s a child, where&#8217;s a child? It&#8217;s all a little bit more, little bit too abstract when you&#8217;re kind of try to figure out how to get it all together. There are so many ways to skin, the cat. So are there answers, so I have a question for you and one is that, is there a way to actually pick up custom fields for custom post types if they were kind of already created or if they are kind of available to use them also in a template or? It&#8217;s probably very hard to do it via UI. That&#8217;s why our advanced custom fields is still for many developers that go to place instead of creating custom blocks for the custom fields. But I think that. Are there any thoughts on that, in this reiteration of the block API?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. So for now, the proposal, that&#8217;s going to be shared next week for replacing parts of HTML with API that allows you to change attributes. That could be a way, you could say that, &#8220;Okay, this field is like going to be replaced with custom field.&#8221; So you give you the name and something like that, but it&#8217;s still not good enough, in my opinion. We need to have a proper way for that in the future. And maybe even more advanced way of defining dynamic in my tokens. The way it works with blocks, ACF Plugin is that they allow linking between an attribute, so it stores the reference to the exact filter in the database. So it stores the number and based on that, it can provide the correct value. So whenever it changes, it updates on the server as well. So it&#8217;s not that easy to do that, but for that ACF has created a special way of writing templates, which takes that into account. It&#8217;s dynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is able to link all the correct numbers and so on. So, I mean, it&#8217;s like having something like that in a more flexible way that works, not only with what ACF provides, it&#8217;s a bigger task and it is definitely something we would like to have, we just need to do it in steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah, no, so that will be the block API, third iteration. Now it&#8217;s the second iteration and then the next iteration is going to maybe, kind of thinking about through that part. Well, excellent. Thank you so much for walking us all through that. And what&#8217;s in the works and what the next iteration of extensibility for blocks actually will look like. That is definitely now that the foundation is in place. Now extensibility has a higher priority, it seems for the Gutenberg project. So I&#8217;m really glad that this took a lot of work to find all the right issues and figure out how to structure that. So thank you for going through that and also leading us through that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Although to be fair, most of the issues were opened by our excellent contributors. I just only did the part of finding them and putting them in one place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And yeah, you helped a lot of people kind of get a good roadmap through that, or at least an idea of what the vision is going to be, so. Because that&#8217;s always a question that we get, so what&#8217;s the vision? And only these tracking issues and overview issues like Matias did and what you did and was also Andrew does for layouts and for style engine all that. Maybe I should share some of the tracking issues. I think I collected about 10 or 15 tracking issues now. From the Gutenberg project, it&#8217;s probably a better way to figure out what&#8217;s current on what people are working on. So yeah, that&#8217;s a call for me to maybe think about some curation of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Well, thank you very much. At the end of the show, we are way over whatever we wanted to do as an hour limit or so, but that&#8217;s okay because you brought so much more insights into what the second iteration of block API is going to hold. Is there anything else that you want to leave our listeners with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I don&#8217;t have anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You don&#8217;t have anything. I don&#8217;t have anything. I said everything that I wanted to say at the beginning in the announcement, in the community and no, I&#8217;m glad you were on the show. Thank you so much for coming.

Ny is a Software Developer at <strong>Howard Development and Consulting</strong> as well as the Editorial Director for <strong>MasterWP</strong>. Ny credits <strong>Ken Elliot</strong> and <strong>Shambi Broome</strong> as mentors who got her into WordPress. Together they\'re getting two new WordPress Meetups up and running in Columbia, SC and Charlotte, NC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Picking up on one of <strong>Kim Lipari</strong>&#8216;s comments last week (<a href="https://poststatus.com/not-a-small-village-anymore-kim-lipari/">“We\'re not a small village anymore.” A Conversation with Kim Lipari</a> — <strong>Post Status Draft 121</strong>), Nyasha shares her thoughts on the ways the WordPress community can better embrace growth and change by enlarging its circles of leadership, innovation, and talent. For Ny, a culture that prioritizes mentoring relationships is essential. She sees value in paid internships at WordPress companies, intentional programming at <strong>Meetups</strong> and <strong>WordCamps</strong>, and the continued use of travel scholarships to welcome new people to an increasingly inclusive WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we also talk about dealing with grief, loss, and emotional health in tech, how social media hurts and helps, and resources like <strong>Big Orange Heart</strong> that are there for you <a href="https://www.patientsrising.org/what-is-spoonie/">when you\'re all out of spoons</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-container-10 wp-block-columns has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background" id="WP-Engine">\n<div class="wp-container-8 wp-block-column">\n<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" /> Sponsor: <a href="https://poststat.us/a2-hosting">A2 Hosting</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A2Hosting offers solutions for WordPress and WooCommerce that are both blazing fast and ultra-reliable.</strong> WordPress can be easily deployed on <em>ANY</em> web hosting plan from A2: Shared, VPS, or Dedicated.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast, which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, creating partnerships to grow your WordPress business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice.

Jonathan joined the WordPress community 17 years ago. And he&#8217;s been here ever since. He likes to think about WordPress as an operating system for creating on the open web, and invests his time and energy into growing the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, he gave a talk at the recent WordCamp Europe called growing in WordPress through partnerships, in which he laid out his thoughts on how WordPress companies can enable greater growth by joining with other like-minded companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of WordPress products out there. And whilst building a product can be a challenge, getting that product into the market, gaining growth and recognition can be another hurdle all together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan talks today about how strategic partnerships can, in some cases, make the job of selling a product easier and more rewarding. We talk about how the WordPress ecosystem has grown over time, and how discoverability of your product is harder now than it used to be. We discussed the fact that WordPress has a heritage of solopreneurs who might not be as good at marketing as they are at coding. And how joining forces with partners can make it easier to succeed in the marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are partnerships for everyone, or are they only for a subset of companies? How do you go about finding a partner and what are the ways that you can ensure that you&#8217;re working with the companies which offer the most benefit to you and your customers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise. But that&#8217;s not the case with these WordCamp Europe interviews. We were competing against crowds and the air conditioning, and whilst the podcasts are more than listenable. I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world we&#8217;re at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WP Tavern dot com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes as well. And so, without further delay, I bring you Jonathan Wold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Jonathan Wold. Hello?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:43] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> Hey Nathan, how are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, you sound truly excellent on this microphone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:47] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> We have an awesome little set here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yes. Well, we&#8217;re in the bowels of the Super Bock Arena in the most undiscoverable bit, but you&#8217;ve managed to find me. It&#8217;s early morning. It&#8217;s the first day. We&#8217;re you here yesterday?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:59] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> Yeah, contributor day was fantastic. It&#8217;s so good to see so many faces, including faces that I thought I&#8217;d seen before, but hadn&#8217;t. You find out that people are taller or shorter than you expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s right. Over Zoom over the last couple of years, you&#8217;ve basically been reduced to a postage stamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:13] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong>Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And people actually have legs. Yeah. So what did you contribute to, what was your bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:18] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> I floated around. Mostly trying to support other folks. There are a lot of first time contributors yesterday, which is fantastic. It&#8217;s so good to see that. So I did what I could to support them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> My understanding was that it was about 60% of people who showed up today will be first timers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> Yeah I think that&#8217;s fantastic. Like it&#8217;s so good to see so many returning faces, but really we want to see the new people coming in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;re doing a talk we&#8217;re gonna talk about that I think. Tell us what the premise of the talk is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:45] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> The talk is focused on this idea of growing in WordPress through partnerships. I&#8217;ve had the privilege working with a lot of product businesses over the years and, I&#8217;ve seen this recurring theme of frustration where a product business, they&#8217;ll have a good product, they&#8217;ll get some good market validation. Maybe some customers that really love the product. And then this frustration where they can&#8217;t seem to tap into the larger ecosystem, like WordPress is huge. Or even just take a sub ecosystem like WooCommerce. There are millions of WooCommerce installs and for a product business, oh, we&#8217;re gonna serve WooCommerce customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it&#8217;s this challenge of how do you get to &#8217;em? There&#8217;s not this like one central place. You could work with WooCommerce, certainly, but even if you do a partnership with WooCommerce, that doesn&#8217;t guarantee that you get in front of all their audience. So it becomes very challenging and frustrating for product businesses, because of how decentralized our ecosystem is. Of which there are many benefits and things that we enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be challenging to say, okay, how do we navigate this? Who do we talk to? Where are all the customers? There&#8217;s some good reasons for that. So in my talk today, I&#8217;m trying to kind of unpack that. Give some perspective, especially to folks who are coming from outside the immediate ecosystem. There&#8217;s a lot of SaaS businesses that have built great products that work well with WordPress. They come in though, and they hit these roadblocks where they&#8217;re like, okay, what do we do? Like, how does this community work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where do we go? How do we act? Where do we focus our energies? And I think it&#8217;s a lot harder right now than it needs to be. Like growth in WordPress is difficult if you don&#8217;t know where to go. And I think that hurts all of us. So, my intent anyway is to try and demystify some of that and then give a clearer path to like, hey, if you wanna grow a product business in the WordPress space, partnerships today is probably your best way of doing so, and here&#8217;s how to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you think this is a function of personality a bit? And what I mean by that is, if you are a born coder and you spend your time in your room and you&#8217;re extremely good at that, this comes out of personal experience. I&#8217;ve encountered lots of people who are extremely good at that side of things. And then they build the thing and the thing is brilliant, but they are not the person to make it go out into the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because they code and then they struggle with that piece of getting it recognized. So they contact podcast owners. They write to blog vendors and so on and so forth. But, it&#8217;s very difficult because you have to be that effervescent, outgoing marketing type of person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:09] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> That is part of it, but it&#8217;s also a timing thing because the coder, if you will, was able to pull it off before. If you think about how WordPress has grown over the past 18 plus years. In the early days, that was enough. You could build a great product and other people would do it for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? You go to a meetup, oh, you gotta use this plugin. That worked, and I think there are folks now who will look at that and like, why isn&#8217;t it working for me as well? Well, that worked more because of just where WordPress was and it&#8217;s life cycle at the time And it doesn&#8217;t work anymore. It&#8217;s just because of how big it is. Or rather it can still work. You can still absolutely grow something by word of mouth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re gonna hit a ceiling though. And if your ambitions are greater, if you&#8217;re wanting to create something that&#8217;s more ubiquitous that solves needs for a much larger swath of the ecosystem, that&#8217;s not gonna be enough. You&#8217;re] gonna have to do the work and get in front of the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is it a product of geography as well? Where you are in the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:02] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> That&#8217;s always a factor in that it can limit who you&#8217;re connected to. Because someone who&#8217;s a great coder, maybe they&#8217;re introverted and, but they&#8217;ve gone to their local WordCamps, and that&#8217;s where they make connections and other folks do the recommendations for them. And so yeah, in that sense, geography could be a limiting factor if you haven&#8217;t had the chance to go all the way around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I was thinking of an example, let&#8217;s say that you live in North America or something. There&#8217;s hundreds of different events that you could attend and there&#8217;s conferences and there&#8217;s countless things where you could present your face. Whereas if you live in a different part of the world where the community just isn&#8217;t there, that&#8217;s gonna be a, a bit of a struggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:33] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> It is, and from my point of view, the struggle existing doesn&#8217;t fit with the ethos of WordPress and it&#8217;s international nature. And that&#8217;s why I think at least in my experience so far and where I&#8217;ve seen product companies have success, like they&#8217;ll be something that very few folks will know about. And then they begin to do the partnership work and approach it in the WordPress way, and then they can build success on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So map out for us what you actually mean by partnership. Obviously everybody gets what that word is basically, but tell us what is it that you are gonna be advising somebody who wants to make hay out of their brand new plugin, theme, block, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:07] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> The way that I think about it, and at least I found most helpful is to start with the audience. You&#8217;re building a product. What audience are you focusing on? Who has a problem that you&#8217;re trying to solve? Be really clear who that is. You could say, oh, small business. Well, small business is still very broad and general. Maybe you have a specific type of small business, whatever that may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with that audience of like, okay, we&#8217;re gonna build a product or maybe you have a product already. And some folks will maybe have a product, they&#8217;re not sure what audience it&#8217;s for, but let&#8217;s just set that aside for a moment. But once you, as the product owner have a clear audience in mind, then it&#8217;s like, okay, who else is already serving that audience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the common mistakes I&#8217;ve seen folks make is they&#8217;ll make a product, and they&#8217;re like, okay, we need partnerships and they&#8217;ll go partner with, uh, a hosting company for instance, but that serves a different audience. Because it&#8217;s like once you know who your audience is, you find a potential partner where you can work together on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then all you&#8217;re really doing is say, okay, what&#8217;s the mutual win. Like how can we together provide more value to that audience? Where I see most partnerships fall apart is where it&#8217;s an audience mismatch. Or maybe they got the right audience, but they still don&#8217;t have a clear value proposition for that audience. The ones that work really well are, same audience or very similar, nice overlap. And then they&#8217;re just providing them value in a way that benefits all the parties involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I feel like a lot of the stuff that you&#8217;re saying makes perfect sense to you, you know, find the audience and so on and so forth. You&#8217;ve probably been through this many, many times. Those kind of processes aren&#8217;t necessarily obvious because you, you might just think I&#8217;ve got a plug in. It&#8217;s for every body, and the whole ecosystem can use this. What is the actual process? I mean, are you literally pen on paper? Have you got like a spreadsheet that you fill out or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:47] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> So, it&#8217;s a good point to bring up the, all the audience. I actually love working on plugins and with authors that are going for all of WordPress. It&#8217;s a smaller subset in general, right? Because like, one of the things I love about how we approach core development in WordPress is, what are the things that serve the 80%. Because WordPress, we&#8217;re not trying to, in the core solve for everyone. And in similar vein, there are product businesses that can be wildly successful that aren&#8217;t trying to do it for everyone in WordPress, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s worth calling out. There&#8217;s still a lot of opportunity to go for ubiquity in the ecosystem. Be clear though on whether that, whether or not that&#8217;s actually your intention. So let&#8217;s say for instance, you are not going for all of WordPress, you&#8217;re going for a, just a sub ecosystem. WooCommerce for instance, a smaller part of WordPress and within WooCommerce you could go for small businesses. You could go for mid-market. You could go for enterprise. Let&#8217;s say you went small business WooCommerce. This is the audience that we wanna work on. They do less than a million dollars a year in revenue, and we have a specific problem we&#8217;re solving for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in just this example, most folks I talk to, if they&#8217;re that clear, they&#8217;re more than halfway there, right. They&#8217;re often not though where it&#8217;s like, oh, we want to do this for everyone, right. It&#8217;s very difficult. And especially when it comes to partnerships where it&#8217;s like, we&#8217;ll work with everyone. In some cases that might be the play, but it&#8217;s often not. Does that make sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah for me, it&#8217;s the actual going through the process. Like, I usually need a form to fill out. Firstly, do this. Secondly, do this. And then, you know, it might be creating the customer avatar and giving them a name and trying to figure out what industry they&#8217;re in and so on. And having that structure, something to hang it on works for me. But it may not be the kind of thing that you would advise people to do when, when going out to get partnerships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:27] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> Yeah It&#8217;s a good question. It&#8217;s a good question, because I guess I am making the assumption that someone&#8217;s clear on who they want to serve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, and that&#8217;s difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:34] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> It can be difficult, because there&#8217;s an inherent choice in who you&#8217;re not gonna serve, right? And again, it&#8217;s worth calling out that when I think about positioning for a product company, to say who, okay, this is who we&#8217;re gonna serve. Doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t also serve others who come to you. It&#8217;s not that you have to turn them away. It&#8217;s making a choice though, on who you&#8217;re gonna focus your energies and your messaging, your positioning on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, it is hard. And it&#8217;s often hard because of that fear of what you&#8217;re gonna miss out on. But when it comes to your marketing efforts, your even your, like your product development, and then in this case, partnerships, if you&#8217;re not clear on who you&#8217;re serving, it&#8217;s very hard to find ways to reach them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So let&#8217;s assume that we&#8217;ve got that piece of the puzzle nailed down, and we know who we&#8217;re trying to serve. What&#8217;s the next step? What does a partner look like? How much are you giving away of your company? How do you contact these people? How do you give the pitch? In a way, trying to find a partner is perhaps equally as difficult as trying to find a customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:31] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> Well, so it&#8217;s a fair point on what does it mean to partner. In general, what I&#8217;m talking about with these strategic partnerships would pretty much never involve any, like giving away part of the company. It&#8217;s more a transaction of like, hey, you have this audience, we have this product, how can we work together to serve them, right? And sure there are a lot of ways that could work. In some cases you might take investment from the partner that you&#8217;re working with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s lots of ways you can approach it. Which is, in my mind a key is to not go into these conversations with everything figured out, but to say, okay, how can we together provide more value to the audience? I sometimes I see folks jump too quickly to like, okay, what are the commercials?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And saying, that&#8217;s a little bit of the cart before the horse, right? Where&#8217;s the value we can provide for the audience. If we&#8217;re not both really clear on that value, it&#8217;s gonna make negotiations difficult, and ultimately probably not be as successful for either party. I&#8217;ve seen product companies do distribution deals with hosting companies, for instance, that are pretty terrible. Where it&#8217;s like, okay, we wanna get our product in front of all your customers. And they&#8217;re like, okay, well, here you go. And it&#8217;s not a good deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are events like this, like WordCamp Europe, are events like this a great way to sort of short circuit the whole finding a partner thing? There&#8217;s thousands of people in this case, all in one room. A proportion of those are they&#8217;re playing that game. They wanna find partners and they&#8217;re looking for people to hook up with. I mean, you&#8217;re in a room it&#8217;s difficult. There&#8217;s no sort of your head saying, I want to partner. So, is that a part of the jigsaw puzzle of an event like this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:59] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> It is, and this is perhaps where personality is more of a factor. I would not advise someone to approach events like this as okay, we&#8217;re gonna go get partners. This is really in my mind more about context development and connecting with folks. Like, yeah, you might have folks, this is someone who I&#8217;d like to work with. And WordCamp can be a great place to build some shared context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, for instance, I would see a WordCamp more as adding personal context to a conversation that&#8217;s already happening. You could certainly meet new folks, but I guess what I&#8217;m trying to say is like, I would hate to see someone put too much pressure on themself. To like attend a WordCamp and like try to get all this stuff done. That&#8217;s not really the vibe of it. It&#8217;s more about building context. If someone&#8217;s new to the space, it&#8217;s like go to contributor day first. Just soak it up a bit. Like one of the mistakes that I&#8217;ll see product companies from outside the ecosystem make, is just be really off on their messaging and positioning. Or being overly aggressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like, no. That stuff is fine. Like it&#8217;s good to see the ambition. Take some time though, to understand the ecosystem, and WordCamps to me are really good for that. So it&#8217;s more about go in curious, and see what you can learn and don&#8217;t make assumptions. And yes, you&#8217;ll probably find some really good opportunities. In general though, it&#8217;s like, if you had a list of folks that you want to connect with, be talking to them already before WordCamp, and WordCamp is more about just seeing them in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So everything that you&#8217;ve just said, I totally identify with, and I do see people not doing that, and I see people showing up and they&#8217;ve clearly got the laundry list of people they want to contact. And it all feels a bit clumsy. Is that a unique thing about the WordPress ecosystem? And what I mean by that is the whole FOSS thing, the free open software. For example, if I was to attend, I don&#8217;t know, a conference about podcasting or something. Is the same audience there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are there different rules at play here? And it feels a little bit like you&#8217;ve got to be a bit more restrained. You&#8217;ve gotta do your homework a bit more because there&#8217;s trip wires everywhere, and sometimes even just etiquette and the things that you mentioned about just don&#8217;t overstep the line, we don&#8217;t know each other yet. We&#8217;re not ready for that bit, but maybe if you are a different kind of an event, that stuff is, I&#8217;m open for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:05] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> In my experience, yes, but most of it&#8217;s hearing that relayed from a software as a service companies, for instance, who are used to other industries where it&#8217;s lot more, not business oriented, but yeah, perhaps more transactional. And it&#8217;s a bit of a system shock to come to a WordCamp. Or even just the idea of how involved volunteers are. Many of us, like if we&#8217;re involved, I&#8217;m helping organize WordCamp US this year. I&#8217;m doing it as a volunteer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that idea of volunteers is kind of an odd one for folks coming from outside. And I think that well typifies, like this is different. People are here because they really want to be here, at least from what I hear. And the other events I attend, it is a very different vibe. Which is why it&#8217;s like, yeah, you can prepare for it, but the starting point is just be open and put out your preconceived notions and take a deep breath. It&#8217;s gonna be okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The whole partnerships thing, is that a piece of what you do when you&#8217;re not at a WordCamp? Is that part of your business life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:59] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> It is, mostly from like an advising perspective. Part of the challenge that I&#8217;m personally trying to see us solve is, I don&#8217;t like that there&#8217;s and it&#8217;s getting better, but having just a handful of folks who do partnerships work in the ecosystem is not good for the ecosystem. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;d like us to see, just become a lot more professionalized and this is just how to do it. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s healthy to have it locked up in just a few people who do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, I&#8217;ll help folks do it. I&#8217;m much more interested though in seeing us open source, like how should this get done? How do we professionalize this aspect of our ecosystem? There&#8217;s a lot more of it starting to happen, but I feel like the advantage in our ecosystem is, has been more to like the few hosting companies who are better at it than others, or the product companies that are better at it than others. Where really, if we can all get better at it, I think the ecosystem as a whole benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So is this more that for the last decade or so, we&#8217;ve had a lot of people who&#8217;ve had a cottage industry for want better word for their job, and the ecosystem, I&#8217;m gonna use the word matured. I dunno the right word, but the ecosystem has matured. It&#8217;s become more professional, so the people who had the cottage industry need to up their game and figure out what the rules are, how to piece that jigsaw together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:10] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> Yes. There&#8217;s a few factors to it. There&#8217;s the folks who&#8217;ve come up through it, like upping their game, which is hard. Well, what&#8217;s happening is that there are a lot of folks, software as a service companies, for instance, wake up and say, hey, more than 30% of our customers are on WordPress. Like 40% of our customers are on WordPress. We need to have a strategy. We need to have an approach. Even just to serve our existing customers better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company that wakes up and says, we need to have an integration. We need to have our own plugin. And there&#8217;s them serve their customers better, which is good for all of us. But then many of them will say, hey, we can grow through WordPress. Like there&#8217;s opportunities here to grow our audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a bit of a clash where what&#8217;ll happen sometimes is these companies from outside will look in and they&#8217;ll see existing behavior and think that&#8217;s how it should be done. But they&#8217;re watching the cottage industry approach. And it&#8217;s like, no, we all need to grow here. The folks who have been in it this whole time, we need to get better at how we do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the folks who are coming from outside need to take a cue and say, okay, well, how do you change and, and work within this culture? It&#8217;s challenging. I&#8217;m encouraged with the progress that I&#8217;m seeing, but it&#8217;s not enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It feels like you&#8217;re a bit worried that if we leave this whole partnership thing unchecked, a decade from now there&#8217;ll be a few major players. There&#8217;ll just be this pyramid structure with a&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:24] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s part of it. And I think it&#8217;s just not healthy for the ecosystem as whole. A great example is contribution to core, right? What I love about all these new folks coming in. I&#8217;ve talked to some of them where they&#8217;ll explicitly call out, like it&#8217;s intimidating to go into like one of the core with thousands of people. And put a reference to a ticket or something. Yeah, it&#8217;s intimidating. And that&#8217;s why we have days like this to sit alongside someone and help them feel comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we&#8217;re gonna continue to grow as an ecosystem, we have to be welcoming to new ideas, new input, and we have to make it accessible for them. And I think partnerships is just a good example of that. Right now, because we&#8217;re so decentralized and may it ever be so, you have to do that work to make the connections happen. And I just, I see a lot of opportunity for that to become professionalized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a really interesting point because when I started building websites, basically you built a website. You found a client, you built a website, you passed it on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then as the industry matured, the job of an SEO expert came along and the job of a copywriter came along. All these little jobs in, WordPress came along. And it feels like you are advocating for a job of some kind of partner interface career. That&#8217;s the job. You need people like that. You need little, little businesses that are set up to figure out how to get plugin company, a theme company, a hooked up with other company B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:40] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So that they can figure out a way to move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:43] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m exaggerating, but if there were only 50 people like really doing this professionally today in the ecosystem, there needs to be a thousand. And this is not a new thing. Partnership management, like business development is not new. It&#8217;s well established, but the folks who, what I&#8217;ve noticed is folks will have those roles in software as a service companies. And just not know how to navigate our ecosystem because they didn&#8217;t grow up in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think for the folks from the outside coming in, it&#8217;s figuring out how to do that same work, the WordPress way. And for us in, it&#8217;s like, how do you embrace that, and learn, okay, well, how do we have to think about this? Like where do we have to grow up? And I think we are more than big enough. And I think that that idea, if there&#8217;s 50 today, there should be a thousand next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If somebody was thinking, actually, do you know what I would like to pivot and become that person? I wanna become some sort of partnership company, whatever it may be. What would be some sort of key things that you think they should be doing today in order to set that business up, you know, move away from whatever it is that they&#8217;re doing and stray into partnerships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:42] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> To me, these types of roles always start with curiosity. Being someone who&#8217;s curious, and really looking for the wins. At its simplest level, it&#8217;s a mutual win between three parties. The customer first, like the audience that you&#8217;re trying to create value for. And then the two other parties that serve that same audience. There will tend to be common patterns of what that looks like. For instance, a product company is often looking for distribution. Like they want to get in front of a bigger audience. And hosting companies often have the distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there, there&#8217;ll be some common patterns. Yet, I think there&#8217;s a lot of room for creativity, especially in these earlier days. And it&#8217;s just being open and curious and staying focused on who are we serving and what problem can we solve for them, and letting that kind of direct how you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ve got a few minutes left. So I&#8217;m gonna pivot the conversation just for a few minutes. We&#8217;re gonna go to acquisitions and mergers. Some interesting news over the last few days that a company that I&#8217;m sure many of us have heard of called Delicious Brains has just recently sold to WP Engine with kind of looks like 90% of their product suite, which is really interesting. But over the last couple of years, lots and lots and lots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you sanguine about this? Is this a good thing on the whole? Does it concern you that a lot is being bought by the same few companies? And at some point we&#8217;re gonna be left with, well, if you wanna do anything with WordPress, you&#8217;re gonna have to go with this hosting company or this other company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:00] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> I&#8217;m, very optimistic by nature. So in general, it&#8217;s like, yeah, I think that&#8217;s all great. There are always trade offs with things I like this in particular. WP Engine they&#8217;ve made some great acquisitions. We could have a whole discussion on the strategy behind this because I think, I think you&#8217;re gonna have less if we just sort of continue as we are, you&#8217;re gonna have, there&#8217;s not that many more Delicious Brains left, no pun intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it makes sense at a high level. Advanced Custom Fields fits their narrative, like the nature of some of the plugins and their suite fits the WP Engine narrative, this focus on developer tools, what they&#8217;re doing with Atlas. At a high level, it makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I wasn&#8217;t surprised and it makes sense to see Spinup separated from that, right. That&#8217;s what they said they wanna focus on. So I like it. In terms of concerns or thinking about the ecosystem broadly, one of the limiting factors I think we have right now is that it is difficult for folks from outside the ecosystem to invest in the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it also comes to a bit to that, like professionalizing. There is plenty of capital out there and, I&#8217;ll talk to founders who don&#8217;t know how to get to it. Like they&#8217;re building a WordPress business. And so there&#8217;s an interesting disconnect right now where if you&#8217;re from outside the ecosystem, they might not get it. Like, what is this WordPress thing? Like, how does this work? They&#8217;ll hear the market share stuff. And it&#8217;s like, okay, we wanna invest, but where do we do that? How do we do that? There&#8217;s some curious gaps at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll put it this way. WordPress businesses in general, in my experience are quite undervalued. If you compare a typical WordPress business to a SaaS, the SaaS will get multiples of value, quite higher than the WordPress business. Where the WordPress business, if you look at it objectively is a stronger investment. So there&#8217;s a disconnect there where the reality is there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity for investors, and the challenge for them is like, how do we navigate this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Curiously, it feels to me like the more things that are acquired, the more need there will be for partnerships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:50] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It kind of feels like the two go hand in hand, if there&#8217;s hosting company X over there, who&#8217;s acquired all the things. And you&#8217;ve got a rival of one of their things. Fighting their marketing machine is gonna difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:00] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> It&#8217;s gonna be difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So need a partner that can help you get through that. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:04] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> Put one way the downside of too much consolidation is that you risk losing the innovation and the market is way more than big enough for new players to be coming in. There&#8217;s lots of sub ecosystems. I think in general, folks just need more help navigating and, as long as we keep seeing new folks come in, we&#8217;re gonna be just fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very last question and a curious little bit of a curve ball. You were talking about the market. The watch word there seems to be growth, growth, growth, the market&#8217;s growing. And yet very interestingly over the last month or so we had some sort of interesting data. This first data point where the market just took a tiny little bit of a dive, not 0.2% or something like that. Any thoughts in your head that the curve is beginning to go in the other way? The seesaw has finally tipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:44] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> We have different sources of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:45] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> So there&#8217;s a whole discussion first about you know, what&#8217;s our basis for data. I think we could have an interesting discussion if we felt confident that that was the case. I&#8217;m working with, um, the HTTP archive on the Web Almanac project this year. And we&#8217;re about to have a new set of data in the next month or so. No particular thoughts. I think, sometimes we overreact. While I am an optimist, we will hit a point at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m much more interested right now in focusing on like for that big swath of market we already have, how can we serve them better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because that&#8217;s really where the growth is gonna come from. Is how do we help more people have success in WordPress? Because in general, there&#8217;s a lot of frustration, like lots of success, lots of things that are going well. When it&#8217;s not working though, where are people going? And they&#8217;re tending to go to the proprietary platforms. Which is fine, but at the end of the day, if we want a healthy open web, we need a healthy WordPress ecosystem. And there&#8217;s still plenty of work to do, regardless of what the numbers are saying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Jonathan Wold. Thank you very much for talking to me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:44] <strong>Jonathan Wold:</strong> Thanks for having me.</p>\n</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 03 Aug 2022 14:00:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Nathan Wrigley";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"HeroPress: Life At The End Of Your Comfort Zone";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=4658";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:146:"https://heropress.com/essays/life-at-the-end-of-your-comfort-zone/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=life-at-the-end-of-your-comfort-zone";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7014:"<img width="1024" height="512" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/080322-min.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: WordPress is big enough for everyone to thrive." />\n<p>It is often said that life, adventure, challenge, growth, etc, begins at the end of your comfort zone. Like all much-abused aphorisms, that is both true and not. Yes, growth comes from outside your comfort zone, but then your comfort zone just becomes bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I get ahead of myself though, I should introduce myself. Hi, my name is Akshat, and I am the founder of BlogVault, MalCare, WP Remote, MigrateGuru and AirLift. I have spent 12 years on a rollercoaster WordPress journey, building these solutions for high performance WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I am going to tell you about my comfort zone. If you are wondering what WordPress has to do with my comfort zone, you’re about to find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id="h-but-first-a-little-context">But first, a little context</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the pre-BlogVault world, I was working at Citrix, doing kernel hacking for a product called NetScaler. This is as far removed from WordPress as you can possibly imagine. I was about to discover my new path rather abruptly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One fine day, The Coding Horror blog crashed. In case you are unfamiliar with this stalwart of the programming world, it is Jeff Atwood’s blog. Jeff Atwood is the founder of StackOverflow, another keystone of the programming community. If Jeff Atwood’s blog didn’t have backups, I thought, what about the legions of sites out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, BlogVault was born; its siblings mentioned above soon to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id="h-stage-1-products-for-problems">Stage 1: Products for problems</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I created BlogVault, I wasn’t thinking about building for people. I saw a problem that I could fix, and created a solution for it. In fact, I understood so little about how people purchase products that every time someone bought a subscription, I thought it was a miracle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, magic wasn’t part of the equation, so I figured that I would have to actually meet people in WordPress. I needed to understand them, and why they were buying my product at all. This was a big step out of my comfort zone, by the way. I do not excel at meeting new people. That may be the understatement of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id="h-hello-strangers">Hello strangers!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, everyone knows that WordCamps are events of inclusion, bringing people from all walks of life together. I didn’t at the time, and attending my first few conferences was me actively putting myself out there. I volunteered at a few, and spoke at others. None of this came easily or naturally, because it was innately difficult to interact with strangers.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Over a few events, the discomfort became less and less, till it has gone entirely.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I met wonderful people and built lasting friendships. For instance, I attended a WordCamp Europe in Spain one year, and got in touch with a friend who lived in the country. We’d never met before, but we’d corresponded a few times. He and his wife came to pick me up, and they showed me around for 2 days. It is incredible that someone can have so much generosity for a virtual stranger.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id="h-stage-2-products-for-people">Stage 2: Products for people</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I crossed the hurdle of interacting with strangers, I started to understand that building a product cannot be done in a vacuum. It is important to consider the people who are going to use it, why they would use it, and how it solves their problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community helped me reframe our products in terms of value propositions. Our marketing evolved to be about creating and showcasing value, and solving issues. I also learned how to use the right metrics to measure interaction. I found myself moving towards a more analytical mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was in stark contrast to how I started: with a gut-based approach and the joy of making. I pivoted quickly to add people into the mix. It feels great—almost romantic—to say we build for the joy of making, but it is not a viable business model unless you factor in people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id="h-the-courage-to-be-imperfect">The courage to be imperfect</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>BlogVault is a great backup product, even if I do say so myself. MalCare is too. MigrateGuru is the stuff of dreams, even. But. BUT. AirLift isn’t. Not yet, anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all products that we have made for WordPress, and have continued to improve over the years. It took us ages after we built MalCare to actually release it. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>It wasn’t perfect, how could we possibly release it?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, I realized that this wasn’t the way to grow. And, I’m not going to lie, it took a lot to overcome this mindset. There were unexpected cheerleaders in every corner, and bit by bit, we were emboldened to take a leap of faith. Customers who loved our existing products encouraged us to let them try our new ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slowly I developed the courage to be imperfect, and trust in the process. We moved forward with the certainty that we would make it better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id="h-a-fair-field-and-no-favor">A fair field and no favor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has been around for decades, and there are competitors on every level. This knowledge contributed to the desire to perfect our product. How will something that is less-than compete with established products in the market? I needed to develop a competitive mindset!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not quite. WordPress is big enough for everyone to thrive. But more than that, it isn’t a dog-eat-dog world. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>The community doesn’t have a win-at-all-costs mentality. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>People here have a lifestyle approach to business, without the hyper competitive spirit. It is a wholesome and largely ethical ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I discovered that the competitive spirit I thought I needed to develop—which didn’t come naturally—wasn’t necessary. I could succeed and make a mark, without that trample-to-get-ahead mentality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(If only I could stop using trite-but-true phrases as adjectives as easily.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id="h-the-wheel-has-come-full-circle">The wheel has come full circle</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>12 years ago, I started my entrepreneurial journey with BlogVault, a definite outsider to WordPress. While I have encountered the boundaries of my comfort zone many times over the years, WordPress has helped me push past them. Today, I can proudly claim to not only be part of this amazing community, but contribute to it in a meaningful way. It is now my comfort zone.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/life-at-the-end-of-your-comfort-zone/">Life At The End Of Your Comfort Zone</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 03 Aug 2022 02:00:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"Akshat Choudhary";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"Post Status: Barriers to Contributing";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"https://poststatus.com/?p=103614";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"https://poststatus.com/barriers-to-contributing/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3377:"<h2 id="h-small-teams-face-frustrating-barriers-trying-to-make-their-contributions-count">Small teams face frustrating barriers trying to make their contributions count</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background"><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Small teams have common barriers to contributing to Five for the Future. Making efficient use of their time and team members is hard when tooling and communication can soak up the hours. Learning how to contribute — and keeping up with WordPress core — makes it hard to get started and sustain effective contributions. How much of this has to do with Trac/SVN and the Make WordPress Slack &#8220;firehose,&#8221; I wonder? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Post Status Slack last month, Cory <a href="https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C038426SA/p1658527463090219">got a number of responses when he asked</a>, </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;As a manager or owner of a WordPress company (or a WP professional), what are your obstacles/frustrations/challenges for contributing to Five for the Future?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A helpful pattern emerged in the responses, which I hadn\'t considered previously.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Direction and Feedback Needed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Patrick Garman</strong> asked for clarity on what\'s wanted and what\'s actually being done for 5ftF. He also shared how tasking a dedicated staff member with a half day to contribute each week was far more effective than spreading it around his team on a totally voluntary basis. Sharing best practices for efficient contribution widely would be valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Sustainable Model of Contribution for Small Teams</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Justin Sainton</strong> agreed that &#8220;sustainable&#8221; contribution for a 1-10 person agency needs a good working model, and he hasn\'t found one yet. Barriers &#8220;include infrastructural issues&#8221; on both ends — the contributor and project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Timi Wahalahti</strong> also spoke to time management challenges in a small 8-person agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Just Keeping Up Takes a Lot of Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thomas Maier</strong> noted the challenges of keeping up with the firehose of WordPress core communication and information: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Keeping up to date with something happening in a team I am interested in working in already needs more than 5% of my and my companies time. That’s the burden for us. I don’t feel that there is a chance to make contributions that count to the project that only need 1-2 hours per week. Assuming that publishing code on GitHub or blogging about solutions don’t officially &#8220;count.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trying to Make the Most of a Few Hours</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Coords</strong> also related to feeling like a few hours a week is not helpful or accomplishing much. He also opined that many employers might rather just donate money to a non-profit at arm\'s length from any interested parties in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One takeaway here for me is that learning/teaching how to contribute and keeping up with WordPress core is hard enough to make it feel like you can barely get to square one as a contributor with a few hours a week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How much of this has to do with things like Trac/SVN and the WordPress Slack &#8220;firehose,&#8221; I wonder? </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 02 Aug 2022 22:03:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Dan Knauss";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"Post Status: Laura Nelson on WordPress and Email Marketing — Post Status Draft 122";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"https://poststatus.com/?p=101223";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"https://poststatus.com/laura-nelson-on-wordpress-and-email-marketing/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3230:"<p class="has-drop-cap">Laura is the Content Marketer at WooCommerce — a popular email marketing plugin for WordPress.

There\'s been a strong comment discussion so far, and I discovered <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/27/giving-fse-a-more-user-friendly-name/#comment-43537">what my view on it is now</a> by noticing what is going on in the grammar of &#8220;Editing&#8221; versus &#8220;Editor.&#8221;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Full Site Editing&#8221; ends with a gerund, which is a verb that\'s used like a noun, <a href="https://theeditorsblog.net/2018/03/07/talk-about-gerunds/">but even more specifically</a>: &#8220;a gerund names or identifies actions, states of being, and states of mind rather than people, places, things, and ideas.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A gerund isn’t a verb showing what someone or something is doing; it is the thing itself that’s doing something or being something or having something done to it.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The &#8230; Editor&#8221; is a noun describing a thing that is also a place. You can &#8220;go into the editor.&#8221; But you &#8220;go into editing mode&#8221; — a change of state, not a different place. You acquire different capabilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe eventually full site editing mode in some WordPress themes will mean you can edit layout (presentation) and content comprehensively. Maybe there will still need to be an option to zero in and focus on one piece of content. Currently, these are two distinct things that feel very different even in FSE themes. Complicating matters, classic, block, and hybrid themes without FSE are totally different user experience contexts.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 02 Aug 2022 03:38:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Dan Knauss";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 37: The World of WordPress on World Wide Web Day";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13198";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/episode-37-the-world-of-wordpress-on-world-wide-web-day/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23622:"<p>In the thirty-seventh episode of the WordPress Briefing, WordPress users and contributors reflect on how WordPress has changed their understanding of the web as we celebrate World Wide Web Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is one of my favorite niche holidays &#8211; World Wide Web Day &#8211; which serves to raise awareness about the origins of the World Wide Web project. WordPress, as part of Web 2.0, only ever had a chance to exist because the web, as we have come to know it exists. So in order to mark this nerdy day on the WP Briefing, I invited a number of community members to share a bit about how WordPress has been a part of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s do some introductions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:01:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/awarner20/">Adam Warner</a>, and I&#8217;m originally from a small town in west Michigan, now residing in Orlando, Florida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:01:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/">Alicia Orrù</a>. I&#8217;m Italian. I was born in the beautiful island of Sardinia, but I&#8217;ve been living in Spain in the province of Barcelona for 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal 00:01:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/thewebprincess/">Dee Teal</a>; Dee is short for Denise. I&#8217;m from New Zealand, but I live In Melbourne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:01:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, my name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/femkreations/">Femy Praseeth</a>. I was born and raised in India and now live in San Jose, California, with my family and cuddly Doodle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:01:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jillbinder/">Jill Binder</a>, and I&#8217;ve just moved back to Vancouver, Canada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:01:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/mariaojob/">Mary Job</a>. I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2015, and I&#8217;m from Nigeria. I&#8217;m from the Western part of Nigeria. Ijebu precisely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:01:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/onealtr/">Oneal Rosero</a>. I am from the Philippines and I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2007.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe</strong> <strong>00:02:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamsirotee/">Theophilus Adegbohungbe</a> . And I&#8217;m from Ilesa, Osun State in Nigeria. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:02:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ugyensupport/">Ugyen Dorji</a> and I&#8217;m from Bhutan. And I&#8217;m working with WordPress for more than five years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I enjoy the most about being part of any community is being able to see how people change and grow over time as they learn and gain confidence in their own expertise. So a favorite early question is naturally, ‘How has WordPress changed your World?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:02:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress changed my world in many ways. But, uh, starting from the moment, it allowed me to become part of a global connected and welcome community. I started using WordPress as a blogger many, many years ago, but it was in 2015 that I started working behind the scenes of WordPress with a plugin company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was the moment when everything changed, basically, because I realized that WordPress was much more than a CMS for creating websites. It was a world full of opportunities for networking, making new friends and walking a new professional path as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:03:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview, I was asked many questions about WordPress and although I had a basic understanding of WordPress, I struggled to give detailed answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that interview, I resolved to develop my skills and learn as much about WordPress as possible. A few months passed and I received a call from ServeMask In, [who] had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration plugin. They offered me a position which fulfilled my wish to work with WordPress full time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because of that, I am now an active contributor to the WordPress community as bread and butter, with the best career in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:04:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are very familiar with my country, Nigeria things here, it&#8217;s not as smooth as it is in other parts of the world. That is, when you are done in school in my university, you have to find means of surviving yourself.&nbsp; There is nothing like the government have work for you. There is nothing like you finish our institution and you get job instantly. So it&#8217;s very tough here. And, year by year, schools keep producing graduates with no companies to employ them and no government job again as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I personally, I was able to gain freedom from this with the help of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:04:51]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress completely changed my work life. I started working independently. I started freelancing with agencies and designers and, uh, building websites from their web designs. And this was around the time my son was born. Actually, he was in elementary school and I think this was around 2014 or so. I started working remotely when remote was not even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were very few companies that let you work from home and remote was not a mainstream thing at all, but with WordPress, I could set my own working hours while my son was in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:29]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, my preferred follow-up question of, ‘How did you hear about us?’ or ‘How did you connect to this global community?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:05:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, actually what I love about WordPress is that it&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s not a business. It&#8217;s not a company. It&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s a community that&#8217;s always ready to help support, teach and encourage people. That&#8217;s how I felt when I joined the community. There&#8217;s always somebody who has your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always somebody who&#8217;s going to guide you. There&#8217;s always an expert who will take your hand and lead you into the beauty that is WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:06:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that I connect with the global community these days are one, of course, is .org Slack. Another of course is Twitter as there&#8217;s a very active WordPress community there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with WordCamps all over the globe. I&#8217;m lucky enough to have been able to travel to several hundred WordCamps through the years in the US and abroad. And that&#8217;s one of the most rewarding parts is meeting people from all over the world and you see really how small and the world really is and how similar we really all are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:06:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not until 2020. I don’t know if you know this lady, a very vibrant lady in WordPress. She&#8217;s from Nigeria; her name is Mary Job, and she&#8217;s really promoting WordPress here. So it was through her that I got to know about the community. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:06:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work is the global WordPress community. So we hold our three programs for the global WordPress community, and we are always trying to reach more and more countries. For quite a while, it was very North America-heavy, and then I made some efforts to expand. And it&#8217;s very exciting that this year, some contributors in our team have actually launched an Asia Pacific branch of our group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we have two meetings every other week where we have the America/Europe and the APAC, and we&#8217;ve also been able to reach other countries as well, but we typically reach something like between 20 and 50 countries a year, depending on the year. So a hundred percent global. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has WordPress, either the CMS or the project, made you feel more connected? And are there any surprising connections that came from WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal&nbsp; 00:07:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the surprising connections I think that have come from WordPress have been the fact that I feel like I&#8217;ve got friends all over the world. And a lot of those have come out of community involvement and from contributing. That I could go to a, a meetup pretty much anywhere in the world and probably find somebody I know, or at least a second degree connection of somebody that I haven&#8217;t, you know, that I might not have met, but know somebody that I know. And certainly that happens fairly regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:08:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress. The WordPress project, the community, has made me feel connected in a huge way, because I am literally surrounded by everything WordPress. So I like how, when you meet somebody who does WordPress, there&#8217;s this instant, ‘Oh, we&#8217;re brothers,’ or&nbsp; ‘Oh, we&#8217;re sisters!’ You know? There&#8217;s that feeling? That&#8217;s how I feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see somebody who does WordPress, as I do, I&#8217;m like, ‘Oh yeah, we&#8217;re, kin.’ You know? We are family. That&#8217;s how I feel when I meet people who do WordPress. And I&#8217;ve met quite a number of people who do WordPress from like around the world. Like I have a friend here, he&#8217;s from the Benin Republic, and we host started a dinner on Friday night and one of my guests was asking me, ‘How did you guys meet?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, ‘Oh yeah, we work in the same WordPress ecosystem.’ He attended our WordCamp, we became friends, and we just literally became really good friends. So I have tons of people that I&#8217;ve met like that I hold in high esteem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:09:12]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Meetups are the seeds that lead to the growth of WordPress communities. WordCamp is a platform for plugin and theme developers to meet WordPress users and website developers. It&#8217;s a great environment where many incredible discussions about WordPress takes place. With each WordCamp there is a &#8220;tribe&#8221; meeting, where I think people [can] get more connected. It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity for aspiring computer engineers, generators and get to showcase their talent and meet each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the project level, it has given me the opportunity to feel like an active part of a global project. The idea that I can give my contribution to making the web a better place &#8211; it’s amazing. And I do so with the Translation team, so making WordPress accessible to all the people that use the core plugins and themes in Italian, and prefer to do that in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What area of the WordPress world is most important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:10:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a little bit of a passion for diversity in tech and diversity in WordPress, specifically around events. And so, here&#8217;s a chance to name the three programs that we&#8217;ve been working on this year. So as mentioned a few times, we have our <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/">Diverse Speaker Workshop</a> that helps people go from not even having the thought that people could step up on stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second program is because of the pandemic. There was no longer the straight path from taking our workshop to speaking, because we used to hold them or people used to hold them for their WordCamps and meetups. And so it was like, okay, you&#8217;ve taken. Apply for our next WordCamp or meetup. But during the pandemic, that wasn&#8217;t a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have this amazing channel that we welcome everyone to join, allies and people from underrepresented groups who are interested in speaking or interested in supporting people and speaking. And that&#8217;s the Diverse Speaker channel <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H">diverse-speaker-support</a> channel on the Make WordPress slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third program is, and we, we went through a name change recently. So I&#8217;ll try to remember the new change it&#8217;s Organizing Inclusive and Diverse WordPress Events. And this is for WordCamp and meetup organizers to learn. We&#8217;ve learned over the last couple years, how important it is to create inclusive spaces and be good allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do we actually do that? And a few of us created a very action oriented workshop in 2019 for WCUS, and that is now the basis of the work that we are bringing to people and people are loving it.. We&#8217;ve had people report a 40%, self-report 40%, increase in feeling prepared to create an inclusive event from before and after taking that workshop, which is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, that’s my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:12:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really love helping the WP Diversity team. I love running the workshops. I love running the workshops for myself, because I used to do training for software back before the pandemic. I used to train up to a thousand people a year in person, sometimes like 500 people in a room at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course I had to shift. I had to pivot to online training, which is what the training team has brought for me. And the focus on the diversity. I like running the workshops. I like running workshops for different groups, different countries, because it&#8217;s nice to meet new people. It&#8217;s nice to hear about their culture, about the limitations that people have in Africa with connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they, they resort to using WhatsApp on their phone in order to do a meetup. That&#8217;s how they do their, their meetings, their discussions. It&#8217;s unlike other countries where we can do video calls. They have to use their mobile phones because connectivity isn&#8217;t accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places like in the Philippines that get affected when it starts to rain a little bit, we lose our internet. So we have backups and our backups have backups. So there are many things that you learn that are different when you&#8217;re living in the city, when you&#8217;re living in the provinces, in the country. So it&#8217;s so many things that you learn about people and how they&#8217;re able to adapt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:13:35]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling end users to reach their goals. And whether that means participating in contributing to the software, to the Core software itself, in terms of UI/UX usability. That can include participating in the community and sharing your knowledge proactively with users who may be new to the platform, or have used WordPress for a while, but now want to step up their game, get a little deeper into using their websites as a tool for growth, for whatever business that they&#8217;re in. So, I mean, overall, the, the most important part of the WordPress world to me are the end users. And, you know, there, there is this quote unquote inner circle of WordPress community people. People who are involved in .org, people who contribute to the software, people who contribute to the 20 plus make.wordpress.org teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those we have to keep in mind, are not the average user by and far. They are not the typical user that hears the word WordPress and then goes out and searches it and then has to figure out how to use it. So I think user experience is probably the most important part for me and making sure that any of that innate knowledge that we have in that inner circle of WordPress because many of us have been using it for so long, keeping in mind that is not the norm. And it&#8217;s not the scale at which WordPress is used and, and making sure we translate complex concepts down to a layperson&#8217;s terms that might not be as familiar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have always found so fascinating about the web and WordPress’ role in it is how it has made the world simultaneously smaller and bigger. By giving voices to the voiceless we help each other find our community niches regardless of where they are in the world. Some of your closest friends could be people you would never meet in your own neighborhood. Well, let’s hear what some of our community members had to say about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Tea 00:15:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the thing that has been most empowering is, is coming into the project either in terms of contributing time and efforts to the community, which is where most of my contribution has been &#8211; has always been about this is a really cool thing, and I really want to build this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ll put my time and efforts into building WordPress. Not for me, but because I see its value and I see its community and I see that the contribution that it&#8217;s making to the world and I, and that&#8217;s really important. But finding that on the other side of that was a huge amount of personal benefit for me in my career, in the friendships that I&#8217;ve made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel like if I had been approaching the community with, I want a better career, I wanna meet all of these people and I want, and I want all of this. From, “I want” for me, instead of, I want for this project, for the community and effectively for the world with that, you know, that whole democratized, the democratizing of publishing is this thing that serves the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s been the key for me is that I absolutely have reaped amazing benefits from it, but it came out of that sense of, I see this value here and I want to contribute to that because it&#8217;s gonna have value, not just for me, but for a whole slew of people. And so, uh, you know, for much, much bigger impact than just on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that&#8217;s the important thing for me is that sense of, if you approach it with that attitude of what can I do to help? It&#8217;s amazing what you will find yourself helped with in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you enjoyed this tour of WordPress in the World Wide Web. I want to share a big thank you to all of the folks who contributed to our little WordPress Briefing celebration of World Wide Web Day today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. So firstly, we&#8217;ve got a couple of updates from our upcoming flagship events. WordCamp US has announced a speaker support fund specifically for historically underrepresented speakers at the event. You can donate to the fund on the page if you&#8217;d like, and there are also directions on how to request support, if you are part of an underrepresented group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the folks over at WordCamp Asia, the call for speakers is live. That&#8217;s taking place in February, 2023. But it&#8217;s never too early to brush up those presentations and get them submitted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next big thing is that there are some changes coming to the WordPress mobile app. A lot of the Jetpack functionality will be removed from it, so this is going to have a little bit of an effect on daily users of the app, but it will also have an effect on regular contributors.

This month we feature Carla Doria, a customer support specialist from South America on how WordPress opened up a new world for her, and gave her the ability to help the local community</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Carla, working with WordPress is a vital part of her life. It gave her a career and a community, in which she she would organize the first WordCamp in her city, Cochabamba, and the first in Bolivia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla studied industrial engineering and has a master’s degree in environmental studies.<br />Her first experience with WordPress was when she decided to start a small business designing and selling cushions and bedclothes.&nbsp;While Carla sat in the small store she had rented, hoping that people stopping at the shop windows would step in to buy something, she decided she needed to create a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>First steps with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla had no budget to hire somebody, but she felt confident&nbsp; she could learn things on her own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Learning to use WordPress requires no code skills or a technical background. It needs an adventurous and playful spirit.” </p><cite>Carla Doria</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She had always been studious, and decided she would figure out how to build a website herself. Carla ended up building a simple blog with WordPress. At the time, she didn’t even have a budget to buy a custom domain, so she used a free subdomain.<br /><br />“Learning to use WordPress is easy. It requires no code skills or a technical background at all. It only needs an adventurous and playful spirit,” said Carla</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were no profits, and any income mainly went to pay the store’s rent. At the time, her previous company contacted her for a job opening that matched her profile. Carla needed that income and decided to closed the store and forget about being an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in employee mode, Carla started her new job as a technical writer for a software development company. Since Carla had completed her master’s degree in the UK, she was proficient in English. Her close affinity for computers and technology made it easy for her to translate complex software jargon into simple tutorial steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Carla got more interested in technical writing and started to improve her writing skills. This reconnected her with her previous enthusiasm for writing, and she decided to channel that interest into a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diving deep</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating her blog helped her become more familiar with WordPress and building websites. In 2015, Carla blogged about writing, her thoughts, book reviews, and everything that came to mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through looking for answers to specific issues using her WordPress blog, Carla found the support forums a useful place to go. Soon she realized that she could also help answer other people’s questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width="600" height="900" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=600%2C900&ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-13189" />\n\n\n\n<p>Carla began checking the forums as a hobby. She liked that she was able to help people and learn more while doing so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of surfing social media during her work breaks, Carla focused on checking the WordPress forums. Through this she learnt about a support job in one of the global firms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt the job was made for her and was excited to support people in building their websites with WordPress. The role offered the possibility to work remotely and travel while still working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years as a technical writer, her career felt stuck. She was certain she did not want to return to any job related to industrial engineering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla did not get through the selection process the first time. But after nearly 18 months between three applications and learning HTML and CSS, Carla finally secured a support job in 2016. With this job, WordPress became her main source of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Leading a local WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the job, Carla learned about the WordPress communities around the world and WordCamps. But when somebody asked about the WordPress community where Carla lived, she didn’t know what to say. Was there a community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She discovered no local group existed, so she researched what was needed to setup a meetup. Carla discussed the idea with others, but hesitated as she thought it would require an expert WordPress developer to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after trying to gauge interest, Carla realized that the only way to find community members was to start a community. In 2017, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Cochabamba-WordPress-Meetup/">WordPress community in Cochabamba</a> was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width="684" height="391" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=684%2C391&ssl=1" alt="The theme preview screen in the WordPress Cochabamba meeting on creating your website with blocks." class="wp-image-13236" /><em>WordPress meeting in Cochabamba explored creating your website with blocks</em>\n\n\n\n<p>The group has had ups and downs, probably similar to any other community. Although Cochabamba is not a big city, they had issues finding a location that was free and available to anyone who wanted to join. People came with different levels of knowledge, from people with&nbsp;vast experience with WordPress to people with no experience but who wanted to learn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community grew during the pandemic, as meetups went online and people from other cities in Bolivia were able to attend. After restrictions were lifted, there was a lot of excitement amongst members to meet each other in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Giving back through speaking</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width="600" height="900" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=600%2C900&ssl=1" alt="Carla reading a book under a tree" class="wp-image-13191" />\n\n\n\n<p>The community also helped Carla to develop a new skill in public speaking. She applied to be a speaker at WordCamp Mexico <a href="https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2019/">2019</a> and <a href="https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2020/">2020</a>, <a href="https://guayaquil.wordcamp.org/2019/">WordCamp Guayaquil 2019</a>, and <a href="https://colombia.wordcamp.org/2020/">WordCamp Colombia in 2020</a>. Her confidence grew while she enjoyed connecting with other communities and meeting people who were on similar pathways. Not all of them were developers, as she had presumed. Many, like her, started out as bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width="977" height="419" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=977%2C419&ssl=1" alt="WordCamp Cochabamba\'s logo with blue and grey lettering and a hat" class="wp-image-13228" />\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, after three years, Carla applied to organize her first WordCamp in 2021 in <a href="https://cochabamba.wordcamp.org/2021/">Cochabamba</a>. She had never imagined organizing any WordCamp, and through this having the experience to talk to sponsors and contact companies, and lead a group of people with different talents and backgrounds. Carla felt she had learnt so much from the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to WordPress, Carla found a job she enjoyed, was able to work remotely, and help build something in her community to help people learn skills and find career opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla feels grateful for all she has been able to do thanks to WordPress. She said: “WordPress has led me to find good jobs. It also has allowed me to contribute to a community of friends that love learning about WordPress.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Alison Rothwell (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpfiddlybits/" class="mention"><span class="mentions-prefix">@</span>wpfiddlybits</a>), Abha Thakor (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/" class="mention"><span class="mentions-prefix">@</span>webcommsat</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/" class="mention"><span class="mentions-prefix">@</span>lmurillom</a>), Meher Bala (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/" class="mention"><span class="mentions-prefix">@</span>meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/" class="mention"><span class="mentions-prefix">@</span>cbringmann</a>), and Surendra Thakor (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/" class="mention"><span class="mentions-prefix">@</span>sthakor</a>) for work on this feature, and to all the contributors who helped with the series recently.

Gutenberg contributors have some ideas and prototypes aimed at giving the List View more context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rich Tabor <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33583">proposed</a> a solution where users can double-click to rename a block within the list, giving it a unique identifier. Gutenberg developer Dave Smith created <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42605">an experimental PR</a> that adds custom labeling/naming of blocks in the List View. It currently works for Group blocks only.

Smith recommended progress on the feature wait to align with the solution in another active <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40393">ticket</a> that seeks to add a metadata attribute to blocks, allowing section naming and future semantic meta information.

The main work for this feature was <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/53751">committed</a> to core for inclusion in the upcoming WordPress 6.1 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial proposal was <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-performance-team-revises-proposal-for-webp-by-default">revised after significant critical feedback</a>. The most notable changes include automatically generating WebP versions of only core image sizes, keeping secondary (WebP) sub-sizes only if they are smaller than the primary MIME type, and only generating WebP images for image sizes that are intended for use in user-facing front-end content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a raft of revisions, and filters to control or disable WebP uploads, the proposal remained controversial. Contributors continue to report issues after testing. Many still have reservations about whether this should be opt-in or on by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When converting medium-resolution photographs (approx 1600px – 2500px on the long edge), WebP files are often larger than the JPEG equivalent,&#8221; WordPress developer Mark Howells-Mead <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:14">commented</a> on the main ticket for WebP work. &#8220;(In my tests using my own photography, in around 60% of cases.) This change might make the &#8216;modern image format&#8217; test of Page Speed Insights happy, but enforcing WebP by default on sites which use a lot of photography will often cause longer image loading times.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some developers are supportive of the change but prefer for it to be off by default when it is first rolled out, to allow the ecosystem to prepare for the change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I definitely see it as a big advantage to add Core support for additional MIME types for sub-sized image files,&#8221; Matthias Reinholz <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:40">said</a>.  &#8220;But I can&#8217;t see adding conversion to a specific other file format as preferred behavior. This may help to optimize the market position of WebP but it will also be a serious threat to plugin authors and existing larger websites that do not pay attention to this change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Therefore, I&#8217;m questioning why this functionality should be activated by default at this stage. <strong>IMHO, it should be opt-in only.</strong> Plus ideally, we would already start to think about adding further image formats to be supported by this feature.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NerdPress founder Andrew Wilder created a separate <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/56263">ticket</a> urging contributors to consider making the feature opt-in, but the ticket was closed and conversation directed back to the main ticket so as not to splinter the discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> &#8220;Making these new features opt-in instead of opt-out would be the best way to be cautious about potential impacts,&#8221; Wilder <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:44">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There have been many requests for this to be opt-in (as well as some asking for a setting on the Media page, rather than only a filter for developers). So far there hasn&#8217;t been any open conversation about why that&#8217;s not being taken into consideration.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The notion that WebP by default should be opt-in was summarily dismissed and the conversation was not revisited before the changes were committed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The feature will have widespread benefits for users by opting in core sizes (to start) &#8211; if it were entirely opt-in it would have little impact &#8211; or benefit,&#8221; Google-sponsored Core Committer Adam Silverstein <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:62">said</a> in response to opponents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to suggestions that this feature ship with a UI for enabling it on the media page, Silverstein said, &#8220;We have discussed both suggestions in chats and issues with mixed responses. Project <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/">philosophy</a> is regularly mentioned as aligning with the current approach.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:69">ticket</a> remains open awaiting patches for a few loose threads on the technical implementation.

Yoast-sponsored contributor Ari Stathopoulos published an <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/07/28/using-locally-hosted-google-fonts-in-themes/">update</a> today to answer some questions the team has been receiving about fonts in themes:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Historically, WordPress themes hosted in the&nbsp;<a href="https://w.org/themes">w.org themes repository</a>&nbsp;were not allowed to use third-party resources. This included images,&nbsp;javascript&nbsp;files,&nbsp;CSS&nbsp;files, webfonts, and other assets loaded from a remote server.</p><p>Google fonts was an exception to this rule because, at the time, there was no reliable way to implement locally-hosted webfonts, and typography is an integral part of a theme’s design.</p><p>Google fonts, however, can no longer be considered an exception to this guideline because of the GDPR and privacy implications.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The team is responding to a recent German court case, which&nbsp;<a href="https://wptavern.com/german-court-fines-website-owner-for-violating-the-gdpr-by-using-google-hosted-fonts">fined a website owner for violating the GDPR by using Google-hosted webfonts</a>. This case spurred a few other threats against website owners and many questions for the Themes team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was previously a strong <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-strongly-urges-theme-authors-to-switch-to-locally-hosted-webfonts">recommendation</a> from WordPress.org is now a warning that guidelines will be changing imminently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A theme should not be allowed to use external resources,&#8221; Stathopoulos said. &#8220;The guidelines right now allow for remote Google fonts, but that will probably change soon. If the theme is using external assets, then yes, it should call a privacy function and ensure that these assets don’t get loaded without the user’s explicit consent.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55985">ticket</a> for updating WordPress&#8217; default themes to load Google fonts locally has a patch but the milestone is set for WordPress 6.1. This will make all the core themes GDPR compliant but will not arrive until October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some theme authors saw the writing on the wall a few weeks ago and have been working to update their themes to load fonts locally. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I spent the day updating all* of my WordPress themes to replace Google Fonts with locally hosted font files, given the recent policy change on the theme directory. <a href="https://t.co/yp6ZHduHjI">https://t.co/yp6ZHduHjI</a><br /><br />(*Chaplin excluded – it supports disabling them in the Customizer.) <a href="https://t.co/eKyRFT4wGm">pic.twitter.com/eKyRFT4wGm</a></p>&mdash; Anders Norén (@andersnoren) <a href="https://twitter.com/andersnoren/status/1542126387078864901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to do this too,&#8221; Rough Pixels founder André Jutras said. &#8220;Although a few themes have a font-choosing option in the Customizer with the full Google selection. This is going to be hard to change with existing users that use it. My new theme will definitely have local fonts.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offering font selection for users inside the theme is not as straightforward as simply including one or two fonts bundled with the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to do the same with Blockbase,&#8221; Automattic developer Jason Crist said. &#8220;But Blockbase ships with a LOT of fonts to choose from so it&#8217;s been a bit of a unique challenge.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, the Themes team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2020/09/25/new-package-to-allow-locally-hosting-webfonts/">created a package</a> that helps theme authors host their webfonts locally. It was created in anticipation of removing Google Fonts as the exception to the rule prohibiting the use of CDNs to load assets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://fonts.bunny.net/">Bunny Fonts</a> are are an alternative to Google Fonts that some plugin authors have on their radar now that some European jurisdictions are cracking down on Google-hosted fonts. It is an open-source, privacy-first web font platform with no tracking or logging and is fully GDPR compliant. Bunny Fonts is compatible with the Google Fonts CSS v1 API so it can function as a drop-in replacement to Google Fonts by just switching the hostname. If the Themes Team was to add any service to its exception list, Bunny Fonts would be a more privacy respecting option than Google Fonts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Themes Team is waiting on core to implement <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46370">better support for loading local fonts</a> before making a sweeping requirement for themes hosted in the directory. In the meantime, WordPress theme authors have the time to update their themes to load Google Fonts locally before a requirement is put in place.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 20:01:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"Do The Woo Community: When You Really Do the Woo with Ronald Gijsel";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72536";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-ronald-gijsel/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:362:"<p>Co-host Ronald shares his experience so far having joined the WooCommerce team at Automattic. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-ronald-gijsel/">When You Really Do the Woo with Ronald Gijsel</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://dothewoo.io">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 08:59:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"BobWP";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:127:"WordCamp Central: WordCamp Jinja: Diverse Speaker Sessions, Web Design Hackathon, Teachers Workshop and Fun at the Nile Source!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3151988";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:148:"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2022/07/wordcamp-jinja-diverse-speaker-sessions-web-design-hackathon-teachers-workshop-and-fun-at-the-nile-source/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13466:"<a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2022/07/image.png"><img /></a>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href="https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2022/">WordCamp Jinja 2022</a> (Fri 2nd– Sat 3rd Sept 2022) will be a major community event in Jinja City, Uganda, where WordPress developers, website designers, online publishers, students and teachers will converge to share comprehensive knowledge and experiences, and to meet other WordPress users.

The terms came into use as WordPress moved into the Customization phase and are still used to differentiate the work being done on site editing as opposed to content editing in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haden Chomphosy has identified two issues with using the term “full-site editing:&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It was already possible to edit every part of a WordPress site using code. The term “full site editing” differentiated between phases of a project, rather than a new capability in the CMS.</li><li>To us, “full site editing” implies the use of blocks, but for new users there’s no reason for them to expect anything else. The term isn’t descriptive of what makes it unique.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors who work in WordPress every day may not be fully aware of how specialized some of these terms are and how little they mean to a newcomer. Haden Chomphosy proposes WordPress adopt a new term that is &#8220;immediately meaningful for new users of our software, while also being an easy to reference term for all of us building and supporting the software.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She opened a conversation today on updating our shared lexicon to use a new term for this aspect of editing and asked for feedback on additional contexts that need to be considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideas are already pouring in as it&#8217;s much easier to name something than to build it. &#8220;Site Editor&#8221; has been one of the must popular suggestions so far, but participants in the discussion have also suggested &#8220;Template Editor&#8221; and &#8220;Theme Builder,&#8221; as well as &#8220;Builder&#8221; and &#8220;Site Builder.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Future view, looking back from collaborative editing, what I would want to tell a user: The Editor,&#8221; Rob Glidden said. &#8220;In the WordPress editor you and your team can edit posts, pages and themes in the same, consistent user interface.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Engine developer advocate Nick Diego suggested it&#8217;s too late to unring the bell on full-site editing and that WordPress should stick with the term. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Many still refer to the Editor as&nbsp;Gutenberg,&#8221; Diego said. &#8220;I would be hesitant to introduce a new name when &#8216;Full Site Editing,&#8217; now that it has been so publicly talked about, will likely live on for years and years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I kind of like the term &#8216;Full Site Editing.&#8217; For new users in WordPress, it implies that they will be able to edit their entire site, which is true. Of course, there are many Classic themes and page builders that also allow you to do the same thing, but a theme that supports FSE differentiates it from traditional Classic themes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion was just opened today and the community is invited to participate with comments on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/27/giving-fse-a-more-user-friendly-name/">post</a>. Those who have knowledge of what users, clients, and people outside of WordPress call the editor in the context of full-site editing should also weigh in to help contributors get a better picture.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 21:46:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:107:"Post Status: PHP 8.2 Compatibility, Renaming FSE, Custom Template Options, WP Feature Notifications Project";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"https://poststatus.com/?p=102947";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:115:"https://poststatus.com/php-8-2-compatibility-renaming-fse-custom-template-options-wp-feature-notifications-project/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16930:"<h2 id="h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-july-27-2022">This Week at WordPress.org (July 27, 2022)</h2>\n\n\n<div class="has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt"><p class="wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt">Getting Ready for PHP 8.2, Rebooting Feature Notifications, Additional Custom Template Options,  and Renaming Full Site Editing. </p></div>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-spacer"></div>\n\n\n\n<div id="kt-info-box_03177a-50" class="wp-block-kadence-infobox"><a class="kt-blocks-info-box-link-wrap info-box-link kt-blocks-info-box-media-align-left kt-info-halign-left"><div class="kt-blocks-info-box-media-container"><div class="kt-blocks-info-box-media kt-info-media-animate-none"><div class="kadence-info-box-icon-container kt-info-icon-animate-none"><div class="kadence-info-box-icon-inner-container"><span class="kt-info-svg-icon kt-info-svg-icon-fas_paint-brush"></span></div></div></div></div><div class="kt-infobox-textcontent"><h2 class="kt-blocks-info-box-title">Custom Template Options</h2><p class="kt-blocks-info-box-text">In WordPress 6.1 you\'ll be able to add custom post type or taxonomy templates.

Currently in its 20.3 release, the mobile app has been part of the WordPress project since 2008 in the <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQC4LY">#Mobile team</a>&#8216;s care. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Paul\'s Make blog post, the WordPress app\'s features and user experience will be simplified this year to reflect the WordPress core experience — by removing its WordPress.com and Jetpack-enabled features. Core features enabled by the WordPress.com REST API will be removed from the WordPress app as well. Everything that\'s being removed from the WordPress mobile app will be added to the Jetpack counterpart app, which <a href="https://jetpack.com/blog/jetpack-mobile-app/">debuted in 2021</a> for iOS and Android. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-container-30 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-7-background-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">\n<h3 id="h-what-s-moving-from-the-wordpress-app-to-the-jetpack-app"><strong>What\'s moving from the WordPress app to the Jetpack app:</strong> </h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stats</strong>, <strong>Activity Log</strong>, <strong>Backup</strong>, <strong>Sharing</strong> (Jetpack Social), <strong>Reader</strong>, <strong>Notifications</strong>, <strong>Jetpack Blocks</strong> (Gutenberg Editor), <strong>@-Mentions</strong>, <strong>Crossposting</strong> (Gutenberg Editor) — and potentially more features.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Everything being removed will be added to the WordPress app\'s Jetpack counterpart, which debuted in 2021 for iOS and Android.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jetpack app recently saw its <a href="https://jetpack.com/blog/jetpack-11-1-under-the-hood-improvements-for-your-site/">11.1 release</a> and the first stages of <a href="https://jetpack.com/blog/build-your-own-jetpack-now-with-individual-plugins/">decoupling its major features into standalone plugins</a>. Currently, the Backup, Boost, Protect, Social, Search, and CRM  add-ons for Jetpack <a href="https://jetpack.com/blog/meet-jetpack-11-0-and-our-new-individual-plugins/">can be downloaded separately</a> from <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/jetpack/">the WordPress.org directory</a>. As mobile app features, they will become exclusively available through the Jetpack app.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, People, Themes, and Menus are features in the WordPress mobile app that rely on the WordPress.com API and will be moved to the Jetpack app to refocus the WordPress app on core-provided APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width="752" height="414" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/multiple-devices-space-752x414.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-102986" />Automattic\'s mobile app for Jetpack.\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-a-response-to-user-login-confusion">A Response to User Login Confusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One significant influence motivating these changes comes from user feedback in app reviews and support requests. These channels often &#8220;indicate confusion around which username and password people should use&#8221; to log into the app and their sites. Since it\'s possible to log into individual WordPress sites or use a WordPress.com account across multiple sites, it\'s not clear which should be used. Worse, &#8220;Using the wrong credentials can lead to vastly different experiences within the app, or frustrating experiences when creating a new account or resetting a password.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>We’d like this change to help make those boundaries clear going forward. Jetpack powers WordPress.com as well as millions of self-hosted sites. For people that use Jetpack on a self-hosted site or via a WordPress.com site, the Jetpack app will be the best experience.                                                        </p><cite>Automattic\'s Jetpack Team</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, the goal for the WordPress app is to ask only for user credentials on the site being logged into. It\'s hoped this clearer distinction between Automattic properties (WordPress.com and Jetpack) and any particular WordPress site will foster greater community contribution to the WordPress mobile app. The WordPress mobile app hasn\'t been clearly represented as a community-owned part of the WordPress.org project for quite some time, so this is a needed and welcome clarification. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not going to be an overnight transition, however. Paul\'s Make WordPress blog post notes user authentication is &#8220;a trickier challenge and something [the Mobile team is] still figuring out.&#8221; It\'s likely to take a longer time to transition .com logins out of the WordPress app to avoid stranding .com users who have been using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-a-response-to-app-store-confusion">A Response to App Store Confusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason for differentiating the WordPress mobile apps is that the Apple App Store and Google Play naturally focus on in-app purchases because they take a cut of those sales. In the past, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21396316/apple-wordpress-in-app-purchase-tax-update-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple rejected the WordPress app</a> because it wanted a 30% cut of non-existent sales in this free app without in-app purchases! To issue updates to the WordPress app, it <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/08/22/apple-agrees-to-allow-wordpress-app-on-the-app-store-without-in-app-purchases-after-update/">had to take in some paid features</a> to comply with Apple\'s rules. Now the Jetpack app will have the freemium model in the app store while the WordPress app will go back to being free without upselling anything to its users.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width="752" height="376" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wordpress-com-vs-org-what-is-the-difference-header-752x376.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-103002" />The differences and boundaries between WordPress .com and .org have always been difficult to identify.\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-clarifying-the-boundaries">Clarifying the Boundaries</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A large part of the problem for WordPress that Jetpack may help mitigate but can\'t address all by itself has been Automattic\'s branding and messaging. The differences between the WordPress.com and .org brands have always been indistinct. For example, the &#8220;WordPress mobile app&#8221; has been (and still is) identified as a &#8220;WordPress.com app&#8221; at <a href="https://apps.wordpress.com/mobile/">apps.wordpress.com/mobile</a> — but it\'s also the .org app. Referring to all instances of WordPress other than .com as &#8220;.org&#8221; is awkward too, and only WordPress community insiders are likely to be familiar with that term and its meaning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, more consistent naming across Automattic properties is in the works, according to Sean Marier. Sean told me &#8220;references to the WordPress app will be updated as part of these changes. It’s worth noting that this may not be immediate but is part of an overall transition plan that the team will be working on in the coming months.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-container-31 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-7-background-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">\n<h2 id="h-what-about-akismet">What about Akismet? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet has long been a standalone, mostly donation-based, virtually unmonetized plugin and a part of Jetpack, as well as fresh WordPress installs. It\'s not going anywhere amid all these other changes to the mobile apps. Akismet will remain everywhere, and based on current hiring at Automattic for a <a href="https://automattic.com/work-with-us/job/director-of-product-marketing-jetpack/">Director of Product Marketing for Jetpack</a>, it looks like Akismet will have a place alongside Jetpack, WPScan, and VideoPress as mid-market products. We can expect to see them introduced with a new pricing structure in the near future.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-changing-perceptions">Changing Perceptions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked the team rolling out all these changes to the mobile apps how they hope Jetpack will be viewed by WordPress users who have looked at it with suspicion because of the blurred boundaries. Their answer:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;We’d like this change to help make those boundaries clear going forward. Jetpack powers WordPress.com as well as millions of self-hosted sites. For people that use Jetpack on a self-hosted site or via a WordPress.com site, the Jetpack app will be the best experience.&#8221;</p><cite>Automattic\'s Jetpack.com team via Chenda Ngak, head of communications for WordPress.com</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes to the WordPress and jetpack mobile apps definitely take big steps in the direction of better boundaries where the community and commercial editions of WordPress are clearly delineated. It\'s important this is happening with a focus on decentralization, core contributors, and the unique ways SaaS and self-hosted WordPress can work together to mutual benefit, as I wrote <a href="https://poststatus.com/an-operating-system-for-the-web/">a few weeks ago</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>In an increasingly competitive market, WordPress can uniquely embrace the strengths of an open platform, taking form as either a SaaS or self-hosted platform — or a mix of both.  </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack is available now as an all-in-one plugin or an à la carte mix of freemium add-ons that allow any WordPress site to leverage WordPress.com\'s services and infrastructure. That\'s quite a step <em>forward</em> by going <em>back</em> to the product\'s original promise. Given sufficient clarity on the boundaries between the free .org community code and freemium .com features, this might be a good and needed model for others. In an increasingly competitive market, WordPress can uniquely embrace the strengths of an open platform, taking form as either a SaaS or self-hosted platform — or a mix of both.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-container-33 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-7-background-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">\n<h3 id="h-what-are-your-thoughts-and-questions-leave-a-comment">What are your thoughts and questions? <a href="https://poststatus.com/planet/feed/#comments">Leave a comment</a>.</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-container-32 wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">\n<p>Can the WordPress and Jetpack mobile apps help clarify the boundaries of the WordPress .org and .com brands and services — and improve the WordPress community\'s view of Jetpack?</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 17:00:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Dan Knauss";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"WPTavern: Automattic Is Removing WordPress.com Features from the Official WordPress Mobile Apps";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"https://wptavern.com/?p=136516";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:106:"https://wptavern.com/automattic-is-removing-wordpress-com-features-from-the-official-wordpress-mobile-apps";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6188:"<p>The WordPress mobile team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2022/07/27/refocusing-the-wordpress-app-on-core-features/">announced</a> today that it will be pulling all the Jetpack and WordPress.com features from the official WordPress mobile apps.

However, these features require the Jetpack plugin or a WordPress.com account to function and can make the app overwhelming for folks who want a simpler experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For the sake of clarity and closer-to-core experience, the mobile team will be working to refocus the app on staple features you&#8217;d find with a fresh download of WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following features will be removed and relocated to the Jetpack app:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Stats</li><li>Activity Log</li><li>Backup</li><li>Sharing (Jetpack Social)</li><li>Reader</li><li>Notifications</li><li>Jetpack blocks (Gutenberg Editor)</li><li>@-Mentions and Crossposting (Gutenberg Editor)</li><li>More features as the team goes about this effort</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic&#8217;s products in the official WordPress apps have been <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-on-ensuring-the-future-of-wordpress">a source of controversy</a> for nearly a decade. Two years ago, when <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-tangles-with-apple-over-lack-of-in-app-purchases-in-the-wordpress-for-ios-app">Automattic tangled with Apple over a lack of in-app purchases in the WordPress for iOS App</a>, the community renewed its call for the company to separate its commercial interests from the official apps. Because Automattic has heavily subsidized the apps&#8217; development, it has been able to add WordPress.com and Jetpack-specific features without contest, but these pose a conflict of interest and are unnecessary for many self-hosted site owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-on-ensuring-the-future-of-wordpress">said</a> the goal with the mobile apps was to get more mobile app users, which included developing things that Automattic deemed most compelling on mobile &#8211; notifications, stats, and the reader. The company has now changed its stance on this, citing &#8220;less user confusion&#8221; as a primary motivator for the upcoming change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;By attempting to cater to such a diverse range of users and needs, there are flows in the app that present many options to users,&#8221; Von Schrottky said. &#8220;An example of this is the current login flow. User feedback (via the app reviews) and support channels indicate confusion around which username and password people should use when authenticating.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the mobile apps have had almost zero contributions from people outside of Automattic. Improving the contributor experience is one of the goals in decoupling Automattic&#8217;s commercial interests from the official apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Although everything is open source, new contributors need to understand the blurred line between community-owned features and 3rd-party hosted services if all they want is to contribute to one or the other,&#8221; Von Schrottky said. &#8220;Also, it can be challenging to understand what functionality and which features are available based on the user’s authentication.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user confusion and contributor complexities have been evident for years. Providing a more straightforward experience for users has just now become an actionable priority. It appears that this is because Automattic is planning to add more paid features. At this point, the more principled move is to expand commercial features in the Jetpack app, instead of bombarding self-hosted users with upgrade prompts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The mobile team has been trying for years to provide a solid, modern experience on mobile, with the goal of helping all users start their WordPress adventure,&#8221; Von Schrottky said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve learned from the diversity and evolving needs of the app user base. In addition to the confusion caused by the current arrangement, the team found that user expectations are confounded by a lack of paid features, such as domain purchases. To better serve the needs of both self-hosted and Jetpack/WordPress.com users in the future, the team is now convinced that adding these specific features in a separate app is the way forward.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic plans to continue maintaining the official mobile apps, advancing the block editor development, and will be listed as the publisher in the store listings for the apps. Once the Jetpack features are removed, users will still be able to do everything included in the core publishing experience, as well as manage settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With this change, we plan for the WordPress app to be a more focused companion to the WordPress.org open source project, leaving the Jetpack app to complement the WordPress.com experience,&#8221; Von Schrottky said. &#8220;This is more straightforward for users of the WordPress open source project and simplifies the relationship between the WordPress app and platform owners like Apple and Google.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Von Schrottky said Automattic is not considering renaming the Jetpack app at this time. WordPress.com users will be able to access the Reader and other .com platform-specific features there. The transition will happen in phases and the mobile team will soon start introducing messages in the app to inform users about which features will be moved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The team is still working out the details of the plan as explained in the post, but this will be followed up with other relevant communications to make this change as frictionless as possible for users,&#8221; Von Schrottky said.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 15:32:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"WPTavern: #36 – Sean Blakeley on Transitioning a Large Agency Over to Gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=136608";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"https://wptavern.com/podcast/36-sean-blakeley-on-transitioning-a-large-agency-over-to-gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38714:"<p>On the podcast today we have <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/sean-blakeley/">Sean Blakeley</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sean works for a large agency called <a href="https://www.americaneagle.com/">Americaneagle.com</a>, a platform agnostic organisation working with enterprise clients on a wide variety of projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After years of experiments with different approaches and collaborations between designers and developers, their team has begun to rely heavily on block patterns, and they’ve found it is greatly increasing their productivity.

How are you doing Sean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:48] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> I&#8217;m doing very well. Thank you, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Sean and I have just been chatting for a few minutes and I think we&#8217;re going to be good friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:53] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> I think you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you&#8217;re at WordCamp Europe. We&#8217;re currently sitting in the basement having a chat, but you did a presentation, which you are now very relieved to have done. It&#8217;s behind you now. What was it about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:05] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> I mean, it was a wonderful, it&#8217;s a wonderful feeling to have been the post talk feeling. Uh, it was about block patterns. The block pattern revolution. I was talking about how we&#8217;re using block patterns in our creative process. How we are evolving and adapting our creative process. Bringing together the designers and the developers, and we&#8217;re finding that block patterns is opening up all sorts of opportunities. Explore and adapt the collaborative space between designers and developers. So, I was really talking about those exciting opportunities that we see today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;re working at the helm, maybe the helm&#8217;s the wrong word, but you&#8217;re near the helm of a very large agency. So I guess making that transition to block patterns was, is a big deal. You got a lot riding on that. Tell us a little bit about the company that you work for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:54] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> So I work for a company called American Eagle. American Eagle are 700 strong. It&#8217;s a large organization. It&#8217;s platform agnostic. Obviously there are dedicated teams to a number of sort of key platforms, including Sitecore and Sitefinity, but also of course WordPress. And that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s really reached that scale. What it tends to focus on is those big enterprise engagements and it, it&#8217;s able to address those kind of cross platform, those big digital transformation pieces, those big integrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you&#8217;re quite right that, you know, as we talk about transitions in organizations of that size, it can very challenging. But because we are, as we are building the WordPress enterprise team, we&#8217;re able to explore some of these different technologies and keep pushing at the boundaries of what we&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have this incredible opportunity to keep exploring. Exploring WordPress at scale, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll talk in a minute about the sort of headness and composable kind of paradigm, but it enables us to keep exploring, to keep pushing these boundaries, and block patterns increasingly feel like they&#8217;re part of that journey and are beginning to become an important part of that journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I would imagine that if we asked a typical WordPress user, how do you build your website? I think there&#8217;s gonna be a significant proportion who, maybe do it the old fashioned way, but I feel that&#8217;s dwindling. Template files and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;ll be a proportion of people probably still I&#8217;m guessing the majority who are using page builders, the commercial page builders. There does seem to be, especially very recently, by that, I mean maybe in the last six months, it does feel like there&#8217;s a lot more chatter about blocks and patterns and almost like, okay, this is a thing now. The time has come, we&#8217;re gonna shift over in that direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, what would you say are the key benefits? The things that you identified in your business which made you say, oh, actually this is worthwhile now. We&#8217;ll stop doing it the way we used to do it, and we&#8217;re gonna start doing it with blocks. What were the key metrics that you judged that worthwhile against?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:52] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> So, the commercial metrics is a kind of separate piece. And we&#8217;ll come back to that, because it is an interesting question. But from a technical or an implementation sort of perspective, it always felt jarring when we were bringing software, proprietary software, be it a page builder or some other service into the WordPress platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It always felt like we were introducing something that we would either have to be pulling out of WordPress at a later date, or we&#8217;re then tying our clients to this particular tool that we had chosen, or, or maybe us as an agency, you know, we preferred a particular page builder. And so that&#8217;s the one that our clients got because that was our preferred approach. And that always felt jarring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It felt like there wasn&#8217;t, you know, we weren&#8217;t developing for the longevity. That we were slightly tunnel vision and, and narrow focused in terms of our needs as the agency, And so it always felt like we should be coming as close to core as we can. Moving our dependency to WordPress itself, rather than this sort of separate proprietary software. And it&#8217;s been a challenging journey at times as we&#8217;ve, we were early adopters for Gutenberg and, you know, we felt some of the pain that, that all of us, or many of us in the community have felt. Some of the challenges around creating custom blocks back in the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was very clear that this felt like the right journey, and it was the right journey to go on. And as we thought about, and talked to our clients about their experience, and their experience for creating content, That goal to move from shortcodes and the abstraction of dropdowns and filling in an input box. And then that leap of faith, as you hope something has changed on the front of your website, and it&#8217;s gonna work in the way that you hoped it would.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that WYSIWYG experience has been something that we&#8217;ve been asked for for years, and of course that&#8217;s where the page builder space came from. But to be able to fulfill that in a drag and drop within the WordPress editor itself is, it&#8217;s a great thing to be able to provide our clients with that experience, that true WYSIWYG experience. And so the goals are so clear as we&#8217;re on this journey together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, and we&#8217;ll come back to that final point around the commercial decision in terms of investing our, our efforts as a technical team. I mean, it was very clear that this is, this is the longevity. This is where we are empowering our clients to own their UI, their UI components. They can start to build out some of their own UI components as well as custom blocks that we might build. And there isn&#8217;t a dependency. If they wanna move to, you know, they wanna change their implementations. They can keep WordPress exactly the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, that notion of switching a theme, and a theme should be easy to change. Your styling, you know, re styling, making small design changes should be relatively easy. Yeah, that&#8217;s becoming true within the Gutenberg paradigm. That we can offer that longevity of, of architecture of platform. And that they can iterate in terms of a design on top of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s been a hugely empowering journey, that incidentally that we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re still on. But we&#8217;re thoroughly enjoying the journey and it&#8217;s, you know, every step that we take can be daunting at times. But, we&#8217;ve found the value in each and every of those steps that we&#8217;ve been on so far as the community, working with Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So at the point where you made the decision to hop on, presumably you&#8217;ve not just said, okay, everything from now on will be based upon Gutenberg. Maybe some clients are embedded in something in the WordPress space, like a proprietary page builder. Maybe you&#8217;re gonna carry that on, maybe not, I don&#8217;t know. But there must have been a lot of retraining, process changes, every which way for your staff. Just talk us through what that was, because obviously if you&#8217;re working within your company and building websites, you want to know, what&#8217;s the education piece? How am I gonna learn all of this stuff? What&#8217;s my company gonna provide for me to make sure that I&#8217;m skilled? Was there a lot of that, that had to be put into place?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:39] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> There was a huge amount. There&#8217;s a kind of duality here that the first challenge was to enable developers to feel confident within React. And so feeling confident within a modern JavaScript framework. And we found that that was a hugely valuable first step to sort of, you know, allow them to ease them into familiarity with React.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we did that, we then moved into Gutenberg specifically and sort of eased our developers into Gutenberg. And we did it some ways from the interface. So getting familiarity with the interface, but of course, things, and we&#8217;re talking maybe two or three years ago now, things were moving so quickly that actually, it was, it was often easier to actually go from the backend forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so look at, the anatomy of a block. How a block fits together and, we had some really curious developers and developers that were often looking under the bonnet and seeing how these things were constructed and it added to that sense, less of intimidation and more of awe that we&#8217;re on a journey together. And actually, you know, we can be part of this dialogue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can be part of this journey and, exploring the how we can evolve our processes. And I think that early, understanding the value that Gutenberg, this journey was gonna provide. Even when we were hesitant to put it into production, but it always felt like this was the direction we wanted to go in. We wanted to provide that extraordinary editorial, content creation experience. And then of course, you know, the value that we can give to end users as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m imagining that if you had clients that were on the classic editor, There&#8217;s just no downside to that. One thing is nothing like the other, so a big boost. But I&#8217;m wondering about the clients who may be, were on those page builders. How are they coping, regardless of all that, how are they coping with the UI? Because even though it is a WYSIWYG, it&#8217;s kind of got some quirk still hasn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UI is a bit funky in places and things don&#8217;t quite match up on the back as they do in the front. I&#8217;m just wondering how your clients and, you&#8217;re a big agency, there must be a lot of feedback coming in. How are they adopting it? Are they welcoming of it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:48] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> Yes, so they are in&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That sounded like aqualified yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:52] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> Well, it is a qualified yes. There is hesitation there at times, because as you&#8217;re quite right to point out, there are some rough edges in the implementation. We try and make sure that we are very transparent. That this is an exciting yet evolving part of the WordPress ecosystem. You know, don&#8217;t consider this as fully finished. It&#8217;s still evolving and adapting. But what we&#8217;re increasingly doing is focusing on a opt in approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the dashboard of blocks can be very intimidating. You know, there is a huge list, particularly if you include the embed options as well. That&#8217;s a huge list. If you happen to be running plugins on your site that are also introducing blocks, you can be talking about many dozens in that interface and you, and I might know the difference with a, a media and text block, but our clients aren&#8217;t going to know that unless we take them on that journey, unless we educate them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we find ourselves doing increasingly is, is white listing blocks. So actually removing, and, and increasingly this is, this is often a principle in enterprise when you&#8217;re working with large scale projects that, it&#8217;s actually putting the guardrails in place, you know. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s having your brand library or implementation, maybe your UI components. But you are limiting the ability of the editorial team to kind of work within those guidelines, that framework. And that&#8217;s how we treat Gutenberg, is that we provide those atomic building blocks, you know, those core blocks, and maybe a few custom blocks as well. We then put limitations in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are your design system, essentially. Those are the UI, the library of UI components that our clients can use. And that&#8217;s really attractive then, because becomes very clear what the tools are that they can use to tell their stories, to tell their narratives to their users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not this self serve mentality where you are kind of building from the atoms and trying to build everything from scratch. Actually they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re sort of pre-baked for you, and you are just going down and, and selecting the ones that you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In WordPress 6.0, we&#8217;ve got, maybe it&#8217;s not the most fleshed out of block locking features, but does something, it puts a padlock icon there anyway, and you can unlock it. That feels like that would be a, a nice direction to go in as well. That particular feature, you know, the client can access this bit, but not that bit. And they can edit this bit, which our team have built. And if they don&#8217;t like the text, they can just go in and do it themselves. And it&#8217;s kind of empowering people to edit their own stuff, but not edit this piece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:18] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> We absolutely love this feature. And interestingly, we&#8217;re actually on a huge project at the moment, a huge headless project. And we were looking at our own custom solution for doing exactly this. So what we&#8217;re doing is, we&#8217;re bringing in quarter of a million programmatically generated pages, that we&#8217;re injecting into Gutenberg blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re kind of generating these Gutenberg blocks. We&#8217;re creating these slot in between the blocks to enable them to insert custom content. But essentially we&#8217;re programmatically generating that content. And then we&#8217;re locking down certain aspects. It&#8217;s almost like a, it&#8217;s a programmatically generated templated page, if you like, which is locked. And then they can add in between these sort of sections or indeed update some of the images. And there are certain areas that we allow them to update and some not so. And so that feature of locking blocks has been already incredibly valuable for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And exactly, as you say, it chimes with that notion of guidelines, of having a brand language. Of having that visual rhythm, your design system, and then you are working within those confines of your visual language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The reason I was talking about it being fairly basic is it can be unlocked by anybody. Doesn&#8217;t matter who you are, you just click the button and you&#8217;ve unlocked it, but, maybe in the future there&#8217;ll be a more granular permissions model that, it doesn&#8217;t matter how many times you click the button, you&#8217;re not unlocking it. That will be nice, you know, so the editor can edit this, and the subscriber could edit this, and the administrator can obviously edit everything. That was a much needed feature, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:54] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> And I think you&#8217;re right. And incidentally, as we talk about maybe block patterns forming that kind of notion of templates that maybe you and I are gonna create a custom post type. And as we click into that custom post type, we&#8217;ve got these pre-baked templates that we can select from and using block patterns to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re exactly right that actually we can even allow editors to edit those templates, but we do have the challenge of permissions. And so we need to think about who has that meta level, almost like the super admin we could think of in terms of multisite. You know, who has that top level, that they can edit the template? And then who are the editorial level can just edit implementations of reflections of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Really interesting. So let&#8217;s get into the whole block pattern thing. I would be staggered if anybody listening to this, hadn&#8217;t heard of them at least. But nevertheless, there&#8217;s probably some who haven&#8217;t. So let&#8217;s just address that. Tell us about block patterns. What are they? They&#8217;re in use, I think more and more. As each day goes by, there&#8217;s gonna be more and more use of them. But just tell us what they are briefly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:54] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> In the simplest terms, block patterns are a contain for blocks. They&#8217;re a kind of vessel, that contain these, whichever blocks you want to allow to be within this pattern. But that&#8217;s deceptively simple. And what I talk about, the analogy that I like to use is that there are a finite number of musical notes, and so whatever your piece of music, your chosen interest is, be it Pixie&#8217;s Debasser, or Mozart or Beethoven, they&#8217;re still utilizing that finite number of notes. And yet they can create truly extraordinary, original compositions from those finite number of notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think for us Gutenberg are our notes, and the patterns are our favorite songs. Are those extraordinary compositions that we can create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Here&#8217;s an interesting thought. If you have a Spotify account, there&#8217;s more songs than you can ever listen to. Block patterns, so in the same way, we&#8217;ve got plugins 50,000, 60,000, whatever the number is. There&#8217;s loads of plugins. If you want a form plugin, go and pick out of the 40 over there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there gonna be overload? If everybody&#8217;s got hundreds and thousands and possibly millions in the future, of patterns. The impediment to creating patterns is so low. The impediment to creating a plugin is quite high. So it&#8217;s contained at roughly 50,000. But if block patterns are gonna be really, really easy to create, which they are, especially with things like the pattern creator tool. Then the library, the way that we download these is, presumably at some point gonna be deluged. Your clients may be faced with this atrophy of, I have no idea where to begin. There are 748,000 in there. And I do not even know where to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:33] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> I think you&#8217;re quite right. That sort of paralysis, choice paralysis will undoubtedly be an issue that we need to deal with, but less like limiting the ability of people to create these block patterns. And really what we need to do is, is have a way of rating those block patterns or seeing those patterns, the popularity of those patterns. The one that seemed to be solving problems that maybe are achieving conversions in a greater way in your particular sector or your area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s having that validation. I think right now are in the, the wild west of we&#8217;re just so excited, and as you say, the friction is so low for creating block patterns. But that in and of itself, isn&#8217;t the goal. You know, and that&#8217;s not where we want to be. Where we want to be is creating truly original and amazing patterns that we can then validate against the use cases for our clients. The way that they want to introduce them into their sites. But yes, we will have a huge number of block patterns very soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There is some editorial on the back of that. It&#8217;s not like you submit a block pattern and it&#8217;s just immediately in the library. There will be a team there looking and inspecting, and hopefully if your block pattern, I can&#8217;t remember what the exact reasons for dismissal were, but it was things along the lines of, if it&#8217;s not really using more than one block, if it&#8217;s not doing something innovative, for example, something along those lines. But given all of that, there could be this problem of just too many things to pick from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:58] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> I think you&#8217;re absolutely right. And then, trying to decide which patterns solve which problems and which to use. That choice paralysis will undoubtedly be an issue that as a community, we then need to start thinking about what&#8217;s the value, what&#8217;s the added value that block patterns are bringing and find a way of communicating that. Both to us as technologists, but also to our clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> One of the interesting ancillary bits of block patterns or blocks or WordPress in general. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve followed this thing, but the Openverse. The idea that you can submit block patterns that have all of the images already in, they&#8217;re probably placeholders. You probably won&#8217;t end up using them, but I do find that&#8217;s quite an interesting piece. For the first time you&#8217;ll be able to download these block patterns and you can actually stick with it. You can use that thing forever and a day, and there&#8217;ll be no license that you are treading on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s totally usable. And I think that&#8217;s really interesting. I&#8217;ve actually been taking tons of photos this week with the intention of, as soon as I get home and I&#8217;ve got a reliable internet, it&#8217;s just to stick them onto Openverse, then people can see pictures of Porto for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:02] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> Beautiful. Definitely, and I think it then raises an interesting question about reusable blocks and how block patterns interact with reusable blocks. And if we have these that you can really just drop in and they&#8217;re instantly displaying those images or instantly sort of showing that you really, you don&#8217;t change, you just drop those in. Whether that&#8217;s more the direction that reusable blocks will go in. Those kind of global blocks. So global entities that we use repeatedly. Or whether block patterns will actually evolve into a version of that. That rather than just being templates, UI components that we reuse, maybe they will evolve into something equally like an opportunity to be global. So, there&#8217;s definitely areas to explore there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When you agreed to have a podcast with me, it sounds subtle, but when I was thinking about it, the more I thought about it, the more I thought, actually, this is fairly seismic. You said that your design process in your agency, as a result of using patterns and the block editor had moved away, I&#8217;ll quote, you said it has moved the expectation, and I&#8217;m guessing we&#8217;re talking about the clients expectation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s moved the expectation from impress us, to collaborate with us. And I think that&#8217;s really interesting because that is a big change. But it sounds like a really subtle one on the face of it. But so you are now it&#8217;s almost like do it, it&#8217;s not DIY, it&#8217;s more like do it with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:23] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> It&#8217;s a profound change. You&#8217;re absolutely right .From being a passive consumer of that process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Taking it off the shelf, the website&#8217;s off the shelf. There it is. It&#8217;s a commodity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:37] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> Exactly that, but also, when we&#8217;ve struggled through a design process and we present that design and we&#8217;ve often got that big gamble moment when it&#8217;s sort of Tada, and hoping fingers cross the client likes the designs that we&#8217;ve created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to address is, want to move away from these big gamble moments. These big, almost waterfall by designers. We&#8217;re doing big design stages and then big build processes. And so Bringing the clients in closer. Often I feel that we solve thousands of micro problems in the course of the design process and the course of the development process, but we kind of hide that away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re not very good at being communicative and transparent about all of those problems that we&#8217;ve solved on that journey. And as we try and bring clients in closer, we want them to own the outcomes. We want them to be on that journey of, here&#8217;s some problems, like framing the problem and, and helping them to go on that journey of, okay, there&#8217;s some compromises here and there&#8217;s some reasoning here that maybe we need to be more mindful of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when they&#8217;ve been part of that process, when they reach the outcomes, when we present that design, it&#8217;s no longer a Tada moment where there&#8217;s surprise, actually they become champions of that design because they have a sense of ownership. That they&#8217;ve bought into it, because they&#8217;ve been part of that ideation session and part of those sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, they go into their organizations and they defend those designs. They can answer any questions about what&#8217;s the reasoning behind this? Or, or why is this like this? Well, well they know, they&#8217;ve been part of those processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, that&#8217;s when it works beautifully, and I&#8217;m not gonna pretend for one moment that we&#8217;ve found the unicorn, that we can all rest happy in our beds, that we&#8217;ve solved design and development, project builds. But with the right client and that right collaboration spirit, we are seeing huge value from this approach to design and development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m really curious as to what that actually looks like on the ground. In other words, presumably there was a transition over to this during the pandemic. Was this, like okay, we&#8217;re gonna screen share on Zoom, and we&#8217;re gonna show you what we&#8217;re doing and you are gonna interrupt us and tell us what you want us to do. Is it literally that? That they are contributing as they watch you do things and learning the process? Or is there more kind of instructional things that you are sending out to them and they approve one as opposed to the other? I&#8217;m just curious what the process really, really looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:09] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> So there&#8217;s no one size fits all. We tend to kind of move with the needs of the client and some clients are more collaborative than others. It sort of bubbled up to two approaches. So one might be that we are providing more regular feedback and regular check-ins. It&#8217;s worth mentioning because it&#8217;s, often designers work in sort of isolation and they, they don&#8217;t like to show their workings out. They don&#8217;t like to show the rough edges. They want to show something that&#8217;s beautiful that they&#8217;ve, worked very hard to create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s often quite hard to get them to actually be more transparent in terms of that process. In terms of their building up of ideas and their iterative, internal iterative approach. And so we&#8217;re increasingly encouraging that. And sometimes that might be the collaboration is that they&#8217;re seeing things much earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, with the right type of client, we can go much deeper. And so what we do is, and I think Nathan, you were kind of alluding to, this is actually we create collaboration sessions. We jump on zoom or equivalent, and we get the designers, we get the developers there, we open up Codepen or something similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And really we start like through the conduit, we kind of play what Dan Mall calls the kind of hot potato process where, you know, maybe the designer is center stage for a moment as we are looking at some typography and maybe some color elements, maybe we&#8217;ve already got a palette established from the guidelines from a brand existing brand guidelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the developer using Tailwind, or again, something similar, you know, there&#8217;s that friction to getting something on the screen is very low. We can start to explore and collaborate together. And, and this is where the client&#8217;s opinion can start to come in, you know? Well, well, what do you think about the use of, this color in, in this formation. Or, what do you feel about the interplay of these different elements?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so what we&#8217;ve found is that trying to do that at the meta level, trying to do that in a kind more old fashioned template driven design. That&#8217;s really challenging. Because that, that doesn&#8217;t really work until you see the whole, and the interplay of all of those components. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s hard to kind of break it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are truly component driven. Well then you can break off, let&#8217;s work on the hero component. And what&#8217;s incredibly valuable about these sessions is the client can tell you instantly that, oh no, we can&#8217;t do that because the marketing team must have a dot, dot dot. Or actually we sell a bit of, we get some, a revenue stream from one of those. It has to be a carousel because we get a revenue stream from one of their slides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that minutiae insight is very hard to unfold in a discovery and definition process. That complexity emerges over time. But if you are in that space, if you are collaborating in real time, you get those insights. You get the business objective insights, coming right into the design and development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How do you feel about, I&#8217;m pretty sure that I know that you don&#8217;t use any of these, but just as a sort of short circuit. How do you feel about these pattern libraries, which have popped up in the last year or so. Where you can go and you can discover template libraries and block pattern libraries. And so these are not the free open source ones that you can get through WordPress, but the proprietary ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you embedded and explored any of those and decided to use them. A minute ago, you were talking about the fact that you were free of all of that with Gutenberg. And I just wondered if you&#8217;d strayed into any of that or had any thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:32] <strong>Sean Blakeley:</strong> So I felt a for a long time that I don&#8217;t like to bring proprietary software into WordPress. As we should all be very mindful of creating dependencies. And that was always true of page builders. It was always a concern that we&#8217;re creating a dependency, a future dependency for our clients, you know, whatever our choice of page builder may have been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the exact principle, the same principle applies here, that we are really creating a dependency. And exactly, as you say, Nathan, this is a young and evolving and adapting area, and maybe we back the wrong horse. You know, maybe the one that we choose is the one that just deprecates into GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we&#8217;ve suddenly got this dependency in one or two of our sites that we have to maintain. And, you know, the support desk need to learn this particular implementation. So, you know, it&#8217;s always interesting to explore. It&#8217;s always interesting to see what the community are creating both in terms of commercial offerings as well as open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m very mindful that we are, it&#8217;s an infinite game. We&#8217;re not looking for those quick shortcuts in terms of implementing something today. And then we are thinking about that partnership with our clients, that life cycle of a platform, you know, of a, a true solution to their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that almost invariably means trying to stay as close to core as we can. We&#8217;re trying to reduce dependencies. We&#8217;re trying to reduce any sort of proprietary dependencies.

You can leave this block intact or remove it entirely.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If the block encompasses some HTML, the user will see a different message sitting above the HTML output:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Your site doesn&#8217;t include support for the &#8220;pluginslug/test&#8221; block. You can leave this block intact, convert its content to a Custom HTML block, or remove it entirely.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>On the front end, self-closing blocks are simply not shown. However, if the block has HTML, its output will appear. This system is better than something like a fatal PHP error on the front end. However, it is often not ideal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, WordPress.org <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2022/07/21/pattern-previews-for-themes-in-the-directory-beta/">began showing pattern previews</a> in the theme directory, as shown in the following screenshot from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/bright-mode/">Bright Mode</a> theme page:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This change is a huge win in showing off a theme&#8217;s design.  In the past, users could not see the patterns without manually installing and testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it brought back that original question about dealing with third-party blocks in patterns. WordPress.org&#8217;s preview system does not have these blocks installed, so it has no way of showing them. There is currently an <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6420">open Meta ticket</a> to address this issue, and the ideal solution would be for the theme directory to simply not attempt to preview patterns for unsupported blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how things are handled in the theme directory, WordPress theme authors have control over whether their patterns appear. Plus, it is generally good practice to not clutter the UI with patterns that do not work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to disable a pattern, keeping it from showing in the UI, is by checking if a particular plugin is active. All you need to know is a function or class name from the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Themes can register patterns either via the <code>register_block_pattern()</code> function or by placing headered files into the <code>/patterns</code> subfolder.  I will cover each scenario in this tutorial. Then, I will offer a couple of alternative solutions that may work, depending on the scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When Registered via register_block_pattern()</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If registering a pattern via the <code>register_block_pattern()</code> function, you should only need to check if a plugin is active before calling the function. The simplest way to do this is to conditionally check for the plugin via <code>function_exists()</code> or <code>class_exists()</code>.</p>\n\n\n<pre class="wp-block-code"><div><code class="hljs language-php">add_action( <span class="hljs-string">\'init\'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{\n    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ( function_exists( <span class="hljs-string">\'pluginslug_some_function\'</span> ) ) {\n        register_block_pattern( <span class="hljs-string">\'themeslug/pattern-abc\'</span> );\n    }\n} );</code></div><small class="shcb-language" id="shcb-language-5"><span class="shcb-language__label">Code language:</span> <span class="shcb-language__name">PHP</span> <span class="shcb-language__paren">(</span><span class="shcb-language__slug">php</span><span class="shcb-language__paren">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>This method is no different from classic PHP-based themes when calling a function or class from a third-party plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When Registered via the /patterns Folder</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns housed in the <code>/patterns</code> folder are auto-registered by WordPress on the <code>init</code> action hook. There is currently no filter to short-circuit this process. This method requires unregistering the pattern instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, you must conditionally check if a function or class exists. If not, unregister the pattern:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="wp-block-code"><div><code class="hljs language-php">add_action( <span class="hljs-string">\'init\'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{\n    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ( ! function_exists( <span class="hljs-string">\'pluginslug_some_function\'</span> ) ) {\n        unregister_block_pattern( <span class="hljs-string">\'themeslug/pattern-abc\'</span> );\n    }\n} );</code></div><small class="shcb-language" id="shcb-language-6"><span class="shcb-language__label">Code language:</span> <span class="shcb-language__name">PHP</span> <span class="shcb-language__paren">(</span><span class="shcb-language__slug">php</span><span class="shcb-language__paren">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<h2>An Alternative: Conditionally Adding Blocks to Patterns</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to register a pattern while conditionally supporting a particular block. For example, suppose your theme supports a contact form block named <code>pluginslug/contact</code> that you want to display in a &#8220;Contact&#8221; pattern. Further suppose that the contact form only makes up one section of the pattern but isn&#8217;t necessarily a requirement for the layout to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method allows all users to make use of the pattern but does not require the third-party block to be installed. It will simply not be a part of the pattern if the user doesn&#8217;t have it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we have access to PHP when building patterns, we can do the same conditional check within the pattern itself. The following is an example of a such a pattern:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="wp-block-code"><div><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>\n<span class="hljs-comment">/*\n * Title: Contact\n * Slug: themeslug/contact\n */</span>\n<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>\n&lt;!-- some core WordPress blocks --&gt;\n\n<span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ( function_exists( <span class="hljs-string">\'pluginslug_some_function\'</span> ) ) : <span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>\n	&lt;!-- wp:pluginslug/contact /--&gt;\n<span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">endif</span> <span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>\n\n&lt;!-- some other core WordPress blocks --&gt;</code></div><small class="shcb-language" id="shcb-language-7"><span class="shcb-language__label">Code language:</span> <span class="shcb-language__name">PHP</span> <span class="shcb-language__paren">(</span><span class="shcb-language__slug">php</span><span class="shcb-language__paren">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>This method can grow complex quickly for themes that require multiple third-party blocks in a pattern or need to perform checks in dozens of pattern files. It is more suited to simple or one-off uses. Otherwise, it may become a management headache.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Alternative to function/class_exists()</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also possible to check if a specific block is registered instead of relying on a plugin function/class name. However, this only works if the block is registered on the server-side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress does not have a dedicated <code>is_block_type()</code> or <code>is_registered_block_type()</code> helper function, but the <code>WP_Block_Type_Registry</code> class does have a public <code>is_registered()</code> method that you can use to check if a block exists:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="wp-block-code"><div><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ( WP_Block_Type_Registry::get_instance()-&gt;is_registered( <span class="hljs-string">\'pluginslug/test\'</span> ) ) {\n    register_block_pattern( <span class="hljs-string">\'themeslug/pattern-abc\'</span> );\n}</code></div><small class="shcb-language" id="shcb-language-8"><span class="shcb-language__label">Code language:</span> <span class="shcb-language__name">PHP</span> <span class="shcb-language__paren">(</span><span class="shcb-language__slug">php</span><span class="shcb-language__paren">)</span></small></pre>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 08:01:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"HeroPress: Finding My Place In The World";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=4641";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:132:"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-place-in-the-world/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=finding-my-place-in-the-world";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22222:"<img width="1024" height="512" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/072622-min.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: The experience was so great and the community so warm, that it pulled me all the way in." />\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/feed/#finnish">Tämä kirjoitus on luettavissa myös suomeksi.</a></p>\n\n\n\nHere is Timi reading his own story aloud.\n\n\n\n<p>From a young age, I’ve been interested in computers. That probably comes from our family tree, as my grandad was a home appliance repairer and father has had a career related to the Internet since the early 2000s dot-com boom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember looking at schematics of different household appliances at our grandad’s repair shop. Thinking how on earth the television game shows, where you could send a text message to “throw” a ball towards the goal on the virtual background behind the host, do work. Spending time at the computer, going thru different websites and being impressed by those. Father being head of e-commerce for a hairdressing industry chain and seeing the growth of e-commerce during the mid-2000s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time I was in primary school and didn’t understand much of what all that was about. And surely wouldn’t have even guessed that someday I would have a career in IT.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-getting-familiar-with-the-internet">Getting familiar with the Internet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, back in the days, you had MySpace, virtual horse stables, guestbooks, IRC-Galleria, and different “website builders”… everyone explored the possibilities of these tools and technologies. You almost weren’t cool if you didn’t. So of course I built a few websites mainly just for fun, like almost everyone else of my age at that time. I also purchased my first domains and made a few sites public. One of those, for a scout group, was “coded” with excel. That’s how I started learning HTML and CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When secondary school started, I did get really interested in sewing, and light-and-audio equipment for live productions. And politics.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Copyright, patent law, freedom of information and net neutrality were hot topics around that time in Finland. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt that the Internet I had grown with, was threatened. The Pirate Party movement had just landed in Finland and they were defending everything I believed in: open access to information and people’s online rights. Despite my young age, they welcomed me, so I got involved with registering the party for elections and in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They used IRC for all the communications, and soon I became frustrated because of missed conversations due to shutting off the computer and thus signing off from IRC as well. That led me to assemble, install and run my first home server so I would always have IRC on. Of course, the new server intrigued me and almost invited to try out hosting the websites myself. That way I learned the basics about Linux, Apache, PHP and MySQL. My interest in these things was understood by only a few classmates and for everyone else, I was a bit of a weirdo. Because of that, I didn’t make many friends from the same age group with me – and that stays true to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-finding-wordpress">Finding WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point in all this, I found WordPress. It was around 2009 and version 2.8 when I installed WordPress for the first time. I immediately started looking for ways to modify and extend the website. One thing lead to another. Soon I had installed WordPress quite a few more times, and even helped one of my friends to set up a website for their parliamentary election campaign. For getting the timeline right in this post, I looked up my old websites and found out that in 2010 I had published a guide on how to translate WordPress into Finnish and even offered some theme translations to download.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet I still didn’t think that IT, servers, websites or WordPress could be my career. When secondary school ended, I applied to study live production. Like audio and lights in concerts and all that stuff. Didn’t get selected for that school, because of the low numbers on the diploma. That was devastating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But little did I know. The third school I applied to, selected me and there I was, going to study multimedia for three years. Photography, video editing, design and a little bit of web development.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-the-most-inspiring-and-toughest-times-of-life-at-the-same-time">The most inspiring and toughest times of life at the same time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, this was one of the most pivotal points in my life. Three years in that school taught me how to be creative with design and boosted my self-confidence in coding skills. Starting almost from the first web development classes, teachers saw my skills and encouraged me to continue coding. I started helping other students during the classes, as most of the web development stuff was already familiar to me. I really enjoyed the print design classes, photography and school in general after a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had also become active in running one of the few Internet cafes in Helsinki that were left in the early 2010s. At the time, we were one of the few places which served only vegetarian food, had open wifi and laptops available for customers. As I was interested in tech and some knowledge, the natural thing was to be involved with maintaining those laptops and the website for the cafe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some same founders of that cafe cooperative had founded another cooperative in the early 2000s, to offer reasonably priced hosting and email services for associations and other NGOs. After some time, they invited me to join and soon I started helping with server upkeep and customer service. I would also make a number of websites with WordPress for our clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>For the first time in my life, I was getting some money from doing things on the Internet.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I started to feel that I had found what I want to do in my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then my partner at the time did get severely ill mentally. That started to affect me as well, and the last year of school with one half at on-the-job training and another half at school doing a bigger final project was very emotional and filled with deep worry. During that year we broke up and that led to depression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t go to school. I didn’t answer the emails or phone calls from my teachers. For a good few months, my life was filled with going out to nightclubs and doing the cooperative work for which I felt a responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, when one of the teachers was calling yet again, I gathered myself and picked up the phone. It was only a month before graduation and I had some courses and a final project to complete before that. Somehow we managed to arrange everything and with the support of all my teachers, the last course was accepted as completed two days before the graduation ceremony.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-not-finding-a-job-in-the-industry">Not finding a job in the industry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Right after graduation, I started looking for a job in the web industry. Tens of applications lead to few interviews, but nobody wanted to hire a newly graduated 18-year-old. I had some experience working in the kitchen from summer jobs, so I started applying to those types of openings, from fast-food chains to being a dishwasher at restaurants in need of income. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Finally, one small school kitchen hired me to do the salads and desserts and help with dishwashing.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months passed, and even though the school kitchen work was nice, I knew that it was something I didn’t want to do for too long. Finland has mandatory military or civil service for all adult males, so I started planning to complete my service soon with the hopes of finding a job in web development after that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only a few weeks before my civil service was due to start, one of the companies I had applied to reached out to me and offered a job. Being thrilled about finally getting a job offer in the industry, I did take that offer right away to learn that I would be a sole developer. At the age of 19. At a company with multiple seriously big clients and custom systems written in PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-finding-wordpress-community">Finding WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During that time, I also learned about the WordPress community in Finland and attended a few very early unofficial meetups. A bit earlier, I had met <a href="https://rolle.design/">Rolle</a> online, who happened to found a WordPress agency around the same time we started offering WordPress websites, on my initiative, at the company I was working for. At its best, we chatted daily and helped each other with our work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast-forward a year. I was hired by a newly founded digital agency whose owners previously used me as a freelancer. It was really inspiring. I learned a lot and submitted my first patch to WordPress core during that employment. But something was missing. The owners didn’t really see the value in the community and, in fact, denied me from attending the first WordCamp in Finland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being very stubborn at that age and really interested in the community based on meetups, I cheated a little and booked train tickets to WordCamp Finland 2015. Ignoring the fact that my bosses haven’t allowed using one workday for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was worth it and a second pivotal point in my life. I finally met Rolle in person and many other Finnish WordPress’ers I looked up to. Including Daniel, who was responsible for Finnish translations for years and Mikko, who was considered a WordPress guru.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-growing-in-the-wordpress-community">Growing in the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The experience was so great and the community so warm, that it pulled me all the way in. I started attending official meetups and over the years first became a volunteer at WordCamp, then organiser and lead the organiser. I also moved to another city and was the first hire in Rolle’s company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, multiple years later, I’m a partner in the very same company called <a href="https://www.dude.fi/">Dude</a>. A Community Deputy and a WordCamp mentor. Our company sponsors my time partially for the WordPress project. I’ve built WordPress websites for Finnish government agencies and big corporates. Mentored WordCamp Europe. Helped numerous WordPress’ers around the world in various ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And found my place in the world. From an industry and community, I could not have predicted, but to which the journey is quite obvious when looking back. A community that does not only share the same ideology that is still important to me, the freedom of information, but helps to make it true. A community whose members I consider close friends, some even as an extended family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are interested in my journey in WordPress Community, there’s a post titled “<a href="https://sipp.is/12-years-with-wordpress/">12 years with WordPress</a>” in my personal blog waiting for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Miten löysin paikkani maailmassa</h1>\n\n\n\nTimi lukee tässä tarinansa ääneen.\n\n\n\n<p>Olin kiinnostunut tietokoneista ja nuoresta iästä lähtien.

Näheeni valtakunnallisen kampaamoketjun verkkokauppapäällikön, isäni, kautta verkkokaupan kasvun 2000-luvun puolivälissä.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tuohon aikaan olin ala-asteella enkä ymmärtänyt isommassa mittakaavassa mitä ympärilläni tapahtui. Enkä olisi koskaan osannut edes arvata, että joku päivä olisin IT-alalla.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-tutustuminen-internetiin-alkaa">Tutustuminen Internetiin alkaa</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Toki MySpace, virtuaalitallit, erilaiset vieraskirjat, IRC-Galleria, Suntuubi ja vastaavat oli tuohon aikaan pienimuotoinen juttu. Kaikki kokeilkivat ja testailivat näitä uusia työkaluja sekä tekniikoita. Et lähestulkoon ollut cool, jos et testaillut. Niinpä minkäkin rakensin ensimmäisiä verkkosivujani, kuten moni oman ikäiseni noihin aikoihin. Hankin myös muutaman ensimmäisen verkkotunnukseni ja laitoin sivuja julkiseksi. Yksi noista oli partiolippukunnalle excelillä “koodattu” sivusto. Tällä tavoin aloin oppimaan HTML:ää sekä CSS:ää.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ylä-asteen alkaessa kiinnostuin todella ompelusta sekä livetuotantojen ääni- ja valotekniikasta. Ja politiikasta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noihin aikoihin tekijänoikeusasiat, patenttilaki, tiedon vapaus ja nettineutraliteetti olivat tapetilla suomessa. Tunsin, että Internet jonka kanssa olin kasvanut oli uhattuna. Piraattiliike oli juuri saapunut suomeen ja he puolustivat kaikkea mihin uskoin: vapaata pääsyä tietoon sekä ihmisten oikeuksia Internetissä. Nuoresta iästäni huolimatta minut toivotettiin tervetulleeki ja näin osallistuin Piraattipuolueen puoluerekisteriin saamiseen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Piraattipuolueessa käytettiin IRC:iä kaikkeen kommunikointiin, ja pian turhauduinkin kun menetin chattilokeja tietokoneen sammuttamisen takia. Näin päädyin rakentamaan, asentamaan ja pyörittämään ensimmäistä kotipalvelintani – jotta voisin pitää IRC:iä päällä koko ajan. Luonnollisesti tämä houkutti ja lähes kutsui minua testaamaan nettisivujen hostaamista itsekkin. Näin aloin oppimaan perusteita Linuxista, Apachesta, PHP:sta aj MySQL:ästä. Ainoastaan muutama luokkakaverini ymmärsi kiinnostukseni näihin asioihin, muille olin hieman outolintu. Ehkä siksi en saanutkaan kovin montaa ystävää oman ikäisistäni – asia joka muuten pätee edelleen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-wordpressin-loytamisen-hetki">WordPressin löytämisen hetki</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jossain kohtaa kaikkea tätä löysin WordPressin. Se oli joskus vuonna 2009 ja version 2.8 paikkeilla, kun asensin WordPressin ensimmäistä kertaa. Välittömästi aloin tutkia tapoja muokata sekä laajentaa luomaani nettisivua. Yksi asia johti toiseen. Pian olinkin asentanut WordPressin jo useampaan kertaan ja jopa auttanut ystävääni luomalla hänen eduskuntavaalikampanjasivuston. Tutkistekin tätä kirjoitusta varten vanhoja sivustojani, ja huomasin että 2010 olen julkaissut ohjeen miten saada WordPress suomeksi ja tarjosin jopa muutaman teeman käännöstä ladattavaksi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silti en vieläkään uskonut, että IT, palvelimet, nettisivut tai WordPress voisi olla joskus ura minulle. Peruskoulun lähestyessä loppuaan, hain opiskelemaan livetuotantojen tekniikkaa. En tullut valituksi päättötodistuksen huonojen arvosanojen takia. Olin lannistunut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mutta vähänpä tiesin. Pääsin kolmanteen hakuvaihtoehtooni ja siinä minä olin, aloittamassa media-assistentin opinnot. Valokuvausta, videoiden editointia, suunnittelua ja vähän nettisivujen tekemistä.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-elamani-inspiroivimmat-ja-haastavimmat-ajat-samaan-aikaan">Elämäni inspiroivimmat ja haastavimmat ajat samaan aikaan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taaksepäin katsoen tämä oli yksi elämäni käännekohdista. Kolme vuotta ammattikoulussa opetti minulle luovuutta ja vahvisti itsetuntoani koodaustaidoistani. Melkein ensimmäisistä tunneista lähtien, opettajat huomasivat kykyni ja kannustivat jatkamaan. Aloin auttamaan muita oppilaita verkkoviestinnän tunneilla, koska lähes kaikki mitä opiskelimme koodaamiseen liittyen oli jo tuttua minulle. Nautin printtimateriaalien suunnittelusta, valokuvauksesta ja pitkästä aikaa koulusta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noihin aikoihin olin myös ryhtynyt aktiiviseksi yhdessä Helsingin ainoista jäljellä olevista internetkahviloista. Tuohon aikaan osuuskuntamme oli yksi harvoista, joilla oli täysin lihaton valikoima, vapaasti käytettävissä oleva langaton verkko sekä läppäreitä lainaan asiakkaille. Luonnollisesti, koska olin kiinnostunut teknologiasta ja jonkin verran kokenut, päädyin auttamaan näiden läppäreiden sekä kahvilan nettisivujen ylläpitämisessä.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samat perustajat olivat perustaneet toisen osuuskunnan 2000-luvun alussa, tarjotakseen järkevästi hinnoiteltuja verkkopalveluita yhdistyksille sekä yhteisöille. Tulin kutsutuksi mukaan tuohon osuuskuntaan ja pian aloin auttamaan palvelinten ylläpidossa sekä asiakaspalvelussa. Tein myös jonkin verran WordPress-sivustoja asiakkaillemme. Ensimmäistä kertaa elämässäni sain rahaa siitä, että tein asioita Internetissä.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alkoi tuntumaan, että olen löytänyt sen mitä haluan tehdä elämässäni.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitten silloinen kumppanini sairastui mielenterveydeltään vakavasti. Se alkoi vaikuttaa myös minuun ja viimeinen vuosi koulussa, toinen puolisko työssäoppimassa ja toinen lopputyön parissa, täyttyi vahvoilla tunteilla sekä syvällä huolella. Erosimme tuon vuoden aikana, ja masennuin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En mennyt kouluun. En vastannut opettajien puheluihin tai sähköposteihin. Muutaman kuukauden ajan elämäni täyttyi yökerhoissa käymisellä sekä osuuskunnan töillä, joihin koin velvollisuutta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eräs päivä, kun yksi opettajista soitti jälleen, keräsin itseni ja vastasin. Oli noin kuukausi valmistumiseen ja minulla oli muutama kurssi suoritettavana sekä lopputyö kesken. Jollain tavalla saimme asiat järjestynään opettajieni tuella, ja viimeinen kurssi merkittiin suoritetuksi kaksi päivää ennen valmistujaisia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Välittömästi valmistumisen jälkeen aloin etsimään töitä. Kymmenet hekmukset johtivat muutamaan haastatteluun, mutta kukaan ei halunnut palkata 18 vuotiasta vastavalmistunutta. Olin saanut kesätöistä jonkin verran koemusta keittiössä työskentelemisestä, joten rahan tarpeessa aloin hakemaan työpaikkoja mistä tahansa ravintola-alalta, pikaruokaketjuista aina ravintoloiden tiskariksi. Lopulta eräs pienempi koulukeittiö palkkasi minut auttamaan salaattien, jälkiruokien sekä tiskien kanssa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jokunen kuukausi kului ja vaikka työ oli mukavaa, tiesin etten halua tehdä sitä turhan pitkään. Niinpä aloin suunnittelemaan siviilipalvelukseen astumista ja toivoin, että löytäisin sen jälkeen oman alan töitä.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vain muutama viikko ennen palvelukseen astumista, eräs yrityksistä joihin olin hakenut palasi asiaan ja tarjosi töitä. Olin innoissani, eikä tarvinnut miettiä pitkään paikan vastaanottamista. Pian kuitenkin opin, että tulisin olemaan yrityksen ainoa koodari. 19 vuoden ikäisenä. Yrityksessä jolla oli isoja asiakkuuksia ja lukuisia itse kehitettyjä PHP-sovelluksia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-wordpress-yhteison-loytaminen">WordPress-yhteisön löytäminen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Noihin aikoihin tulin myös tietoiseksi suomen WordPress-yhteisöstä ja osallistuin muutamaan ensimmäisistä epävirallisista tapaamisista. Hieman aiemmin, olin tustunut netissä <a href="https://rolle.design/">Rolleen</a>, joka sattui perustamaan WordPress-toimiston samoihin aikoihin kuin meidän yritys alkoi tarjoamaan WordPress-sivustoja aloitteestani. Parhaimmillaan juttelimme päivittäin ja autoimme toisiamme työssämme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pikakelataan vuosi. Olin palkattu vastaperustettuun digitoimistoon, joiden omistajille olin tehnyt joitain vuosia aiemmin hommia freelancerina. Tuo aika oli todella inspiroivaa. Opin paljon uutta ja lähetin jopa ensimmäisen pienen korjaukseni WordPressin ytimeen. Mutta jotain puuttui. Omistajat eivät oikein nähneet arvoa yhteisössä, ja itseasiassa kielsivät osallistumasta suomen enimmäiseen WordCamp-tapahtumaan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jääräpäinen kun olin, ja erittäin kiinnostunut yhteisöstä, huijasin hieman ja varasin junaliput osallistuaakseni WordCamp Finland 2015 -tapahtumaan. Huolimatta siitä, että minua oli kielletty kuluttamasta työpäivää siihen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Osallistuminen oli sen arvoista ja toinen käännekohdista elämässäni. Tapasin vihdoin Rollen ensimmäistä kertaa livenä, sekä muita suomen WordPress-maailman hahmoja joita ihailin. Mukaanlukien Daniel joka vastasi suomenkielisistä käännöksistä pitkään sekä Mikon, jota pidettiin lähes WordPress-guruna.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id="h-wordpress-yhteisossa-kasvaminen">WordPress-yhteisössä kasvaminen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kokemus oli niin mahtava ja yhteisö niin lämmin, että se veti heti mukaansa. Aloin osallistumaan virallisiin WordPress meetuppeihin säännöllisesti ja vuosien aikana ilmoittauduin ensin vapaaehtoiseksi WordCamppiin, sitten järjestäjäksi ja lopulta pääjärjestäjäksi. Muutin toiseen kaupunkiin ja olin Rollen perustaman firman ensimmäinen palkkaus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nykyään, vuosia myöhemmin, olen osakas tuossa samassa firmassa nimeltään Dude. Osa kansainvälistä yhteisötiimiä ja mentoroin WordCamppeja. Firma sponsoroi osan työajastani WordPress yhteisön hyväksi. Olen ollut mukana tekemässä nettisivuja valtionhallionhallinnolle ja isoille korporaatioille. Mentoroinut maailmans suurinta WordCampia. Auttanut lukuisia WordPressin käyttäjiä ympäri maailman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ja löytänyt paikkani maailmassa. Alalta ja yhteisöstä jota en olisi voinut koskaan ennustaa, mutta johon matka on selkeästi nähtävissä kun katsoo taaksepäin. Yhteisössä, joka ei ainoastaan jaa kanssani samaa ideologiaa joka on edelleen minulle tärkeä, tiedon vapaus, vaan myös auttaa tekemään siitä totta. Yhteisössä, jonka jäsenet ovat tärkeitä ystäviä ja osa jopa melkein kuin perhettä.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matkastani WordPress-yhteisössä kiinnostuneille, henkilökohtaisesta blogistani löytyy kirjoitus “<a href="https://sipp.is/12-years-with-wordpress/">12 years with WordPress</a>”.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-place-in-the-world/">Finding My Place In The World</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 08:00:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Timi Wahalahti";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"WPTavern: Akismet 5.0 Adds New Spam Detection Feature That Analyzes How Comments Are Posted";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"https://wptavern.com/?p=136573";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"https://wptavern.com/akismet-5-0-adds-new-spam-detection-feature-that-analyzes-how-comments-are-posted";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2157:"<p>For years, the vast majority of Akismet releases have been centered around bug fixes and improving compatibility with various plugins. <a href="https://blog.akismet.com/2022/07/26/version-5-0-of-the-akismet-wordpress-plugin-is-now-available/">Version 5.0</a> was released today, following 4.2.5 earlier this month, with a <a href="https://blog.akismet.com/2022/07/26/spambots-theyre-not-just-like-us-introducing-akismets-newest-spam-fighting-feature/">new feature</a> that should improve Askismet&#8217;s ability to detect spam comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet engineer Christopher Finke explained how the plugin will now analyze how a comment is posted, in addition to analyzing what is posted:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A typical human commenter on the Web takes about 40 seconds to read a blog post and another 40 seconds to write and submit a comment.

These benchmarks are some of the most trusted review sources in the hosting industry due to Ohashi&#8217;s transparent <a href="https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/methodology/">methodology</a>. No hosting company sponsors the work. Instead, Ohashi charges a standard, publicly documented fee for participation that covers the cost of the tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, Ohashi tested 33 companies with 79 different plans across seven different price tiers, including the WooCommerce tier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If speed is one of your chief concerns when selecting a hosting company, these performance reviews may be of interest. The benchmarks include a Load Storm test designed to simulate real users visiting the site, logging in, and browsing (uncached performance). They also test cached performance, SSL, WP queries per second, performance on some computational and database operations, and a WebPageTest that fully loads the homepage and records how long it takes from 12 different locations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results are easy to examine at a glance. Top Tier (Full Star) status is given to hosts that perform well under the battery of tests:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Top Tier WordPress Hosting (Full Star)</strong></p><p>This is awarded to companies who maintain 99.9% uptime throughout the entire testing and show little to no performance degradation during load testing, primarily focused on error rate and consistent response times. Error rates above 0.1% and response times above 1000ms* will keep a company away from achieving Top Tier marks.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the budget &lt;$25/Month category, the 2022 Top Tier winners included 20i, 34SP, EasyWP by Namecheap, Eco Web Hosting, GreenGeeks, HostXNow, ICDSoft, LightningBase, MechanicWeb, Pressable, SiteGround, and WPX.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, in the <a href="https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/benchmark/2022-enterprise-wordpress/">Enterprise tier ($500+/month)</a>, there were far fewer participants but the majority of them achieved Top Tier status, including Performant Websites, Presslabs, Scaleforce powered by Virtuozzo, Servebolt (Scale + ACD), Servebolt, and WordPress VIP.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second year Ohashi has performed WooCommerce hosting reviews. The tests are performed on a WooCommerce dummy website with Storefront set as the theme and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/master/sample-data/sample_products.xml">sample products</a> loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top Tier winners for WooCommerce hosting include GreenGeeks, Pressable, Servebolt, and WordPress.com.  Two others achieved Honorable Mentions &#8211; ICDSoft and SiteGround. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking on &#8220;View full results&#8221; for any of the tiers will show a detailed breakdown of all the tests with comparison charts and summaries for each host participating.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WordPress Hosting Is Getting Faster</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think the most remarkable trend is how fast things are getting,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;For example if we look at the enterprise tier from 2021 vs 2022, the fastest average response time (Static test) was 9ms and 6.4ms and p95 was 41ms to 20ms. The 3rd fastest p95 last year was 65ms which would be 7th (out of 9) fastest this year if you moved it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Despite the numbers already being staggeringly fast already, the whole cohort accelerated even faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not just at the high end, at the &lt;25 tier, on the Static test there was 1 company with under 100ms p95 last year (CynderHost &#8211; 61ms). This year you have three &#8211; Pressable (18ms), SiteGround (67ms), WPX (89ms).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At the slow end, the slowest &lt;25 Static average response time was 267ms, last year there were 5 companies with equal or slower averages (max being over 1200ms).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohashi said there may be some selection bias as companies who do badly may not want to participate again and filter themselves out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But some of those companies improved quite a bit like GoDaddy was 295ms to 234ms which is a 61ms improvement,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to call out the companies who have sometimes struggled on these tests, and keep participating. I respect them and it makes me happy to see them making continuous improvements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While I do give awards for companies who do well, I think it&#8217;s important to recognize that not doing as well isn&#8217;t a failure, it&#8217;s about what the companies do with that information and how they improve their services. Overall, it seems everyone is improving and that&#8217;s a win for hosts and consumers alike.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohashi said one of his goals for 2022 is talking with the companies to explain the value of participating. Beyond the value of the benchmarks themselves, these reviews help the ecosystem push for better performance. One of Ohashi&#8217;s testing policies is a big driver for this: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;The hosting packages are as close to default as possible. In some circumstances where turning on performance enhancements is very simple, e.g. clicking an option to turn on caching, this will be done. These changes must be obvious or communicated clearly in the welcome email so that every user is guaranteed to at least be presented the option. Otherwise everything is as-is for new customers upon sign up to avoid, as much as possible, the extra benefit of companies knowing they are being tested.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies that do well in these tests are those that have embraced performance by default, so that any performance improving technology is already turned on or presented proactively to customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the things I got a degree in is economics and we talk about opt-in vs opt-out policies like organ donation and how defaults can drastically influence outcomes,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;By forcing opt-in performance improvements, I don&#8217;t know how many thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of sites have been positively impacted by these benchmarks without ever being aware because hosting companies are forced to enable better defaults.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohashi also works with the companies on things that do not make it into the benchmarks, such as pointing out issues with onboarding/UI/UX experience and reporting bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve probably used more different WordPress hosting companies than anyone else in the world at this point (I have to be in the top 10 doing these benchmarks for a decade right?),&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I cannot figure out how to do something in your system, it&#8217;s probably your system, not me. I truly want to see everyone do better, because everyone wins in that scenario and I will try to help as much as I can to make that happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href="https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/">2022 WordPress Hosting Performance Benchmarks</a> for a more detailed breakdown of all the different pricing tiers and a full explanation of the testing methodology. Past years&#8217; benchmarks are also available on the website. This year Load Storm went out of business, so Ohashi replicated the tests into k6. All of his load testing scripts are open source and <a href="https://github.com/ReviewSignal/k6-WordPress-benchmarks">available on GitHub</a>, so others are welcome to use them for testing their own sites or building their own testing suites.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 02:40:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"WPTavern: SiteCare Acquires Maintainn from WebDevStudios";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"https://wptavern.com/?p=136520";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"https://wptavern.com/sitecare-acquires-maintainn-from-webdevstudios";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2720:"<p>More consolidation is happening in the WordPress maintenance services space, as SiteCare <a href="https://sitecare.com/blog/sitecare-acquires-maintainn/">announced</a> it has acquired <a href="https://maintainn.com/">Maintainn</a>, a long-time competitor, from WebDevStudios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As we’ve grown and our clientele has grown [with] definitely more of a focus on the enterprise and big business, we’ve simply kind of grown away where that side of the house wasn’t really in line with the web dev side of the house in terms of the clients we&#8217;re working with,&#8221; WebDevStudios CEO Brad Williams said in an interview with <a href="https://thewpminute.com/wordpress-support-company-sitecare-acquires-maintainn-from-webdevstudios/">The WP Minute</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So it’s been a bit of a, struggle in terms of how best to support those clients, because of course we want to take care of our clients and they are a big reason why we’re here. That’s why, Lisa, my partner, and myself, kind of took a step back and said, maybe this doesn&#8217;t make sense for WebDev, where we&#8217;re at, where we&#8217;re continuing to go.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WebDevStudios began focusing more on taking on larger, more technical projects that run WordPress at scale for clients like The Wall Street Journal, Starbucks, Microsoft, Viacom, and the NBA, the company struggled to effectively market Maintainn with messaging that conveyed its distinction from WebDevStudios&#8217; enterprise development offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Struggle of the message, the marketing message to say, hey, we can support, blogs, SMB all the way up to, enterprise and Microsoft is a hard message to get across,&#8221; Williams said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We knew that the marketing of that would be almost impossible for us to, to nail. It really just came from the separation of where WebDev was kind of growing more towards the enterprise and Maintainn was primarily supporting more of that SMB to to mid-tier.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintainn&#8217;s current maintenance plan customers, which range from $49-$249/month, will remain at the same pricing for one year. SiteCare may reevaluate these pricing tiers in the future. Customers are promised the same level of service as their current plan but may also receive some enhanced benefits that they had not received before. In addition to maintenance services, SiteCare also offers its customers a range of digital marketing services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is SiteCare&#8217;s second acquisition of a WordPress site management company after acquiring WP Site Care in 2018. The company will take on all of Maintainn&#8217;s assets but the employees will remain with WebDevStudios.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 18:47:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"Gutenberg Times: Live Q &amp; A: Block-First Approach at Pew Research Center";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=21696";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"https://gutenbergtimes.com/live-q-a-block-first-approach-at-pew-research-center/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67881:"<p>On July 22, 2022, Michael Piccorossi, Head of Digital Strategy and Seth Rubenstein, Lead Developer at Pew Research Center talked to co-hosts Anne McCarthy, WordPress Product Liason and Birgit Pauli-Haack, WordPress Developer advocate and curater at Gutenberg Times, on they use a mixture of Core and Custom Blocks to streamline their publishing process, and to create powerful charts and quizzes for the Pew Research Center.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="toolbelt-video-wrapper"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://github.com/sethrubenstein/gutenberg-times-livestream-examples">Seth Rubenstein&#8217;s Example Code Repo</a> (GitHub) </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/37943">Issue: Allow usage of block based &#8220;template parts&#8221; without using block based &#8220;templates&#8221;</a>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbGFDbmN0Y3ViaFFBU1RHM0xtYkZ4cVV5RGgyZ3xBQ3Jtc0tsSGRKTzhCRGJQc3Bpd3kzc1A5cVo0dmM4WThacVJyLXhCa1NDSllzckwtLUNxSTlKajZDTmtKUFhfN3h2TXdNb29ESkh5MVczNVZGNE03WnlldDdDM09uNUlxZ3BEZTlBYTNPTGNNWlFEMHJyV3cwVQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3aWn55a&v=bvQYPa5vxVk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://bit.ly/3aWn55a</a> (GitHub) </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/comparing-patterns-template-parts-and-reusable-blocks/">Comparing Patterns, Template Parts, and Reusable Blocks</a> (WordPress Support) </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/24934">Tracking issue: Missing Query block functionality</a> (GitHub) </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/07/11/fse-program-testing-call-15-category-customization/">FSE Program Testing Call #15: Category Customization</a> (WordPress Make Blog)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connect on Twitter </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Michael Piccorossi <a href="https://twitter.com/mpiccorossi">@mpiccorossi</a></li><li>Seth Rubenstein <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFYwNDRSQ2gzdEtDNUhYcFhLY0F5QmtrQlZEQXxBQ3Jtc0trVEdjY25XR1dFOWNWY3BvYS1vX0I0elcwbjlWeVhLaVFMRkM2T3hzWk1yV1g5QUxWeHlKbHMwX1R4bjR3Sm5lLUpEQlVaaUVqRno2TnpkcEJTbG9hUUdzaXJ6VWg1ckptSHRCTUtKTVJDNzVrZ3Jjcw&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FSethRubenstein&v=bvQYPa5vxVk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@SethRubenstein</a></li><li>Pew Research <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbVBuZ09tWjB1Nms5OVEyRUlsS3J5eEdfQVZNZ3xBQ3Jtc0tubXkzMkUxTDBsQ2FyQ2xma3dsYmRydkxldzlmUTZSMVJSZjZSSVZMdGMzbXVKbnNpdXhDeXVqQ2tQM3E4MU1kQzMyVi1tNmNxU3QteHg2VTNmMkc1ckJNOXZNVS1OUkJtLVJhRFJ6aWhVbWJTX2VMZw&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fpewresearch&v=bvQYPa5vxVk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@pewresearch</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Speaker information</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-container-11 is-nowrap wp-block-group alignwide">\n<div class="wp-container-9 is-vertical wp-block-group">\n<img /><strong>Michael Pioccorossi, Director of Digital Strategy</strong>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael Piccorossi is the Director of Digital Strategy at the Pew Research Center where he leads a multidisciplinary team that includes web development, design, product, user experience, analytics, social media and video.

My name is Birgit Pauli-Haack, and I&#8217;m the host of and the publisher of Gutenberg Times. Thanks for joining everybody. With me is a co-host, Anne McCarthy, who&#8217;s the WordPress Product Liaison. Howdy, Anne, thank you for being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Thanks for having me. I&#8217;m very excited to introduce how we&#8217;re going to talk to folks in the Pew Research Center about how they use a mixture of core and custom blocks to streamline their publishing process and to create a lot of the stuff that you know and love from them, with their charts and quizzes and all that good stuff. So with me here today, Seth Rubenstein, lead developer&#8230; Rubenstein. Apologies, lead developer and Michael Piccorossi Director of Digital Strategy. Thank you both so much for coming Seth and Michael apologies if I completely ruined both your last names and thank you so much for taking the time to just talk about all the cool stuff you&#8217;re doing at the WordPress block editor.

Minor details, Michael, how are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: I&#8217;m doing great. Thanks. Thanks for having us. We&#8217;re really excited to talk about the work that we&#8217;re doing and how we might help other people with what they&#8217;re trying to do. So, thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So I&#8217;m so happy. Totally thrilled. I couldn&#8217;t wait because we were talking about this since end of May and now it&#8217;s end of June. I had to wait two months, but we do proper introduction in less than a minute, but I have a few housekeeping notes. So please use the chat feature to let us know where you are watching from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then for the question process, for those who are watching on YouTube livestream, use the chat bot next to the video player for your questions. Here on Zoom, use the Q&amp;A button on the bottom of the screen for your questions and the chat bubble to share your thoughts and comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little reminder, yes, please be kind even if you disagree. This is a family-friendly endeavor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So before we head first into the behind-the-scenes tour we are going to get, I want to ask both of you to tell us briefly about your WordPress story and how long have you been using it. Seth first, and then Michael.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Sure. I&#8217;ll go first. I mean, I&#8217;ve been using WordPress for, I don&#8217;t know, 18 years or something like that now? I started using WordPress in college. I was responsible for all the school&#8217;s clubs and newspaper, websites and all that stuff. So that&#8217;s when I started to learn WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I just went successively from one job to the next, building out different WordPress products. I think I built one of the first learning management systems in WordPress many, many years ago, in my first job. Then I started at Pew in 2015 and they were doing some interesting stuff with WordPress and WordPress Multisite and we just went from there. I&#8217;m excited to show you what we have built over the last couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, that&#8217;s a great career and a lot of nonprofit and going from Drupal to WordPress must have been a major switch of culture as well. So, Michael, how about you? What is your story?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;ve been doing digital stuff for more than 20 years, more years than I like to admit sometimes. Prior to Pew Research, I managed a team at U.S. News &amp; World Report. We built a custom-based, a Python-based CMS and e-commerce system. That was back like in 2006. So I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of different content management things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started at Pew Research in 2009. When I got here, we had four different CMSs, none of them WordPress, 2 DotNet, Drupal, custom PHP so it was really kind of a mess. One of my first hires after I got here was another person you may know from the WordPress community, Russ Heimlick. He was our first web developer and he and I talked about where we should take this organization and we decided that WordPress was the right way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we ran a custom-hosted version out of a data center in Virginia for a while and then Seth joined us, as he said in 2015. For a couple of years, we were managing on our own AWS infrastructure and then we moved over to WordPress VIP in 2018, and we&#8217;ve been really happy working in that environment ever since. So we&#8217;ve really never been happier and we&#8217;re really committed to the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I love this. This is very cool. I&#8217;m going to later have a question so just tuck this away for now, around why you chose WordPress, especially with what seems to be more of an emphasis on the data side of things. I&#8217;ve read books about how for humanity&#8217;s sake, we need to find ways to preserve data for the long term. So I&#8217;m curious, that played into part of, for human knowledge sake of, what platform can we choose that will have the most longevity and sustainability into the future? So I&#8217;m fascinated by that entire concept when it comes to this kind of work and research, but just tuck that away for later. I just had to mention it for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Oh, Birgit, you&#8217;re muted. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; to type some things. I apologize, our chat was disabled for a few minutes here and now you can all tell us where you&#8217;re watching from. I&#8217;m sorry about that, but it seems to be that Zoom is changing the default settings all the time, and I had this set up. Well anyway, so Michael, so what do you exactly do at the Pew Research Center?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Sure, sure. So me personally, I&#8217;m the director of Digital Strategy. It&#8217;s really product and strategy and like I said, I&#8217;ve been here for 13 years now. So I oversee a larger team of 20 people. In addition to the web dev, I also oversee the design team, video products, social, email, user experience, and audience measurement. So basically I&#8217;m the chief cat hurder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we&#8217;re similar to a lot of news organizations. So I really describe us as, we&#8217;re news adjacent. So, the work of the center is, if you&#8217;re not familiar with it, we are a nonpartisan, non-advocacy, public opinion polling, demographic analysis and a variety of other social science research. Historically, the roots of the center is in survey research and polling, but in the last five years, we&#8217;ve really made a strategic shift to seek new ways of measuring public opinion and that facilitated us starting our data labs team. They&#8217;re doing data science and computational social science so that&#8217;s a new area of research for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our core product, as is baked into our name is, nonpartisan, non-advocacy research. So these authoritative, data-driven reports, they&#8217;re big things, they&#8217;re multi chapter, and those are still really in many ways, one of our core products, but we also do shorter but equally rigorous and authoritative data-rich blog posts and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the digital team here also, in addition to doing all of the regular day-to-day publishing, we&#8217;ll publish in a given year maybe 40 or 50 data-driven features based on center research. And they run the gamut from D3 visualizations to interactive maps, data lookup tools, essays, and quizzes. And I don&#8217;t want to overlook the fact that we&#8217;ll publish about 2,500 static charts in a given year and it&#8217;s really an important part of how we get our information out there. So shout out to our design team, I think they&#8217;re the best in the business and I think they do great stuff. So it just doesn&#8217;t have to be interactive to be important to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think in general, one of our real special sauce for these features that we do is, allowing users to see themselves in our data. So Anne mentioned some of our quizzes and things like that. That&#8217;s really in terms of broad reach, we know that for the public, that&#8217;s what they want to see. So that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, like I said, we are really similar to a news organization and we&#8217;re involved in a lot of the same communities as news orgs, Online News Association, NYCAR, the News Product Alliance, those are sort of the people we hang out with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to being a pointing head and middle manager, I&#8217;m really a product guy at heart so I really do spend a lot of time in WordPress. So that&#8217;s my story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Well, thank you, Michael. I had no idea about the full scope of the Pew Research Center. I only have been an avid reader of the internet research since the early 90s, I think because that was the one research where you knew who&#8217;s online and who&#8217;s online where, and especially then with the advent of user-generated content, social media, it was really nice. Yeah. It was the one authority about internet usage, especially in America. So I&#8217;m really happy that I know now more about it. So Seth, what do you do at Pew Research Center?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Well, I am the lead developer. So when I started at Pew, there were a few developers, but there wasn&#8217;t a defined dev team and there wasn&#8217;t modern dev team practices. So a lot of the challenge was getting that spun up in the first couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we have three other developers beside myself. We have two developers that focus on these digital features that Michael alluded to maps, interactives, we call them scrolly teleinteractives. You scroll through and different things happen. Then another developer and myself, we manage the majority of the WordPress app and especially now, the Gutenberg infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I just want to go through the chat. Hi to Washington DC. Heimlich is here. No. Nice, wonderful. Bud is here. Hi Bud. Henrietta, Matt and well, yeah, Ann is online the chat and thank you for greeting everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the Genesis of this live Q&amp;A is actually that I, around the Web 6.0 release, Seth tweeted the following, &#8220;For all its naysayers, Gutenberg is a gamechanger for digital and news apps. It&#8217;s a force multiplier for your team and we&#8217;ve spent about the last three years going all-in, in block development.&#8221; Then in the thread, you shared quite a few videos of examples and it was really interesting. I jumped at it and DMed you if you and your team come on the show. So what is it that you&#8217;re going to show us today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Sure. So I have a couple of examples from that kind of thread. I think we&#8217;ll dive in and I&#8217;ll show you how we can build out homepages, that&#8217;s one thing, how we are using Gutenberg in a quasi full-site editing method to edit taxonomy archive pages, as well as a couple examples of how we build out digital features like quizzes, like charts and interactives now, some of these scrolly tele things I&#8217;ve told you about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have this other concept of a quote sorter, where we get quotes from the public and we sort them into different groups and things so you can browse that information. We&#8217;ve just created the ability for this, and it&#8217;s not launched yet, to build those out in Gutenberg. So let me share my screen here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that would be lovely. Well to the audience, if you have questions, just put it in the chat and after the demo, well, Anne and I get the privilege of first questions and then we&#8217;ll go through your questions and have Seth and Michael answer them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Go ahead, Seth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; So the first thing that you see when you hit pewresearch.org is this page here. In the past, this might have been something built out with God knows how many short codes, if that was even possible at all. So now, and I&#8217;ll just kind of, I have a couple tabs lined up here, now, it&#8217;s very simple for an editor to come in and build out a homepage, especially with things like block patterns. We&#8217;ve established some of these basic sections of the homepage that you can just drag and drop in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s see, I&#8217;ll just throw one together real quick and maybe we&#8217;ll do that. So the first block that we built in our journey on Gutenberg was what we call story item block. It&#8217;s definitely our most used block. It&#8217;s our most custom, the most developed out block. With it, you can just drop in a story and we have a couple of different variations. We&#8217;re using block variations throughout our block library for quick shortcuts to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: It&#8217;s so cool you&#8217;re using variations for this, I just have to say. I&#8217;m like&#8230; I&#8217;m already seeing the pieces and like this is amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And using WordPress REST API and all of the WordPress components to build these things out. So let me just type in a post. I&#8217;m running this on my local dev so it will be a little bit slower. An editor can just search for a post or they can drop in either a live link or another feature that they requested, which I think has come in handy is the edit URL for like an article that&#8217;s not been published yet, so we can go try to grab some information about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then once in here, this block is using block context as well. We have found block context to be extremely important to our efforts, to guide producers into how things should be set up and set restrictions on how things should work. So for example, we have our own grid block as well. If I were redoing it today, I probably would stick with the core column blocks, but this was years ago and there were some features and stuff and we didn&#8217;t know how to tap into core blocks the way we do now. So we just went through and made our own grid block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The column block passes down through block context, the width of the column so that, for example, a story item block, when you&#8217;re choosing the image position can say, &#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t do left or right position because this column is not large enough.&#8221; So this is great because this makes sure that, once again, I go back to shortcuts because this is how it used to be. With shortcuts, you really could place those restrictions on the interface that maybe had to happen on the back end and an editor would go and drop in a short code and they will, &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t look the way I wanted it to look. I didn&#8217;t know about these restrictions.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now an editor can come in here and do all this visually. They could set an image size, enable different features, like bulleted items underneath here. They can include links in here, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we are also using the query block. This is one of our more recent core block modifications. I&#8217;ll actually get rid of this to show you how that works. So you can drop in a query block and we are registering through the block API, our own variation here. We&#8217;ve got all the basic query block things, but we&#8217;ve added our own thing, which will drop in the default settings for the story item block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, I think also alludes to what I was describing in that thread of our block first approach. Everything is a block in the site, or at least everything&#8217;s moving in that direction, to be a block in the site. To give you an idea of what that looks like, lets just save this real quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important thing and probably the most important thing about Gutenberg is the fact that what you build here, hopefully is how it&#8217;s going to look on the front end. We&#8217;re still dealing with some typography stuff. I think when we go in all-in a full-site editing, that&#8217;ll be more one-to-one. But now if I come over to our new homepage&#8230; Come on. What I&#8217;ve built out here is exactly as you&#8217;re going to see it on the front so there should be no mistakes, there should be no, this doesn&#8217;t look how I thought it was going to look like, all that stuff is visible in the back end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the front end here, in the query block, obviously, I&#8217;m sure most people aren&#8217;t aware the nuts and bolts on how the query block works, but on the back end, obviously there&#8217;s a block called post template block and that is rendering out your blocks using PHP on the backend. This is a story in a block, basically being rendered out in PHP on the backend. These aren&#8217;t actually static blocks. These are dynamic. So the query block gets the information. It says, &#8220;There&#8217;s a post type we want a query,&#8221; then it outputs all that using the story item block as a template. So that&#8217;s homepages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the other thing I wanted to dive into was the taxonomy pages. Where do I have that? So this is an example of a taxonomy page for us, our most important taxonomy topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Sorry, but so what I&#8217;m hearing is, that you are actually way ahead of the Gutenberg team. You have build query blocks and templates all before it actually went to the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; We did build out our own query block originally, because when we first started looking at doing query blocks in places, the query block did not have taxonomy support, or at least very, very minimal taxonomy support. That&#8217;s since changed so we have now moved over to the core query block, but there were a lot of cases where we had to build out stuff before it was ready in Gutenberg, and then come back later and figure out if we were going to use the core block that Gutenberg had built out. In the most cases we do, we do end up going with whatever the core block is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is, I think, our best example of our approach to full-site editing before we got full-site editing. So this is your standard taxonomy archive page, but we have two positions, one we call menu and the other we&#8217;re called top. Actually, we have another one at the bottom called bottom. These link up to a post type that we&#8217;re calling taxonomy block area, which is not super creative, but it describes what it does. There&#8217;s a taxonomy for that for location, menu, top, bottom. So you can go into here and you can say, edit the menu, edit the top, whatever and just like on the homepage, you can build out these featured content areas in Gutenberg using whatever block you want, in this case story item. We also have a promo block we built out on our own MailChimp block and that&#8217;s what you get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi:</em> Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Then&#8230; Yeah, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: I just wanted to add, yes. So last summer we launched a site redesign with a whole new information architecture and a multi-level content taxonomy. As Seth pointed out, these topic pages were really the central component of that entire redesign. Being able to manage these in the ways that he&#8217;s discussing has really been transformational for us. One of the things I like is, you can create one of these topic blocks and assign it to multiple pages if they&#8217;re the same. We can also create these pages in a very short period of time, literally in minutes. Usually, it&#8217;s more the editorial decisions that take longer than any of the actual production stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; So yeah. Yeah. The other nice thing is that you can schedule these, because we are ostensibly, a news site. We, I think we, Mike alluded to, like to think of ourselves as being a resource for the news rather than being an actual news service, but we post things that are on the topics of the day and so we can change these. We can schedule changes out. We can schedule tomorrow&#8217;s homepage, we can schedule next week&#8217;s big release of some report we have, we can schedule the topic page changes that&#8217;ll happen for that, because this is just a post-type. So we just create a new post, slot it into this topic in the top location and schedule it for next Wednesday to publish at 10:00 AM. This will change at 10:00 AM. So that&#8217;s also, I think been a really great feature and that of course applies to homepages and any of these full-site editing things that we&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the other thing is that we&#8230; This is one of the things that we&#8217;re going to have to struggle with in the next couple months is, we also built out our own navigation block. When I say we built out, we forked the early efforts of the Gutenberg team&#8217;s navigation block and we went a little bit further with how we needed it to work. So a lot of that change was making these different menu links that would point to topic pages specifically, and stuff like this and the ability to have a sub menu and that would follow our CSS and stuff like that. So that&#8217;s taxonomy pages, that&#8217;s full-site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing I wanted to show was quizzes. We might not have enough time to show us some of these other interactive, but the quizzes stuff, this we launched last fall in order to support what is by far, our most popular product. I mean, it blows our analytics out of the water every year. That is our political typology quiz. It&#8217;s definitely one of our complex interactives too. If you haven&#8217;t taken this, you should, it&#8217;s pretty fun. People will enjoy it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;ve taken this with friends, like at a bar years ago. We&#8217;re like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s all take the quiz and we can talk about it.&#8221; Yes. This is really fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; And we have a group feature too. So if you sign up for an account on our website, you get a little login and you can go create your own little community group. So you can say, here&#8217;s how this group of people is responding to this, which is fun. So here&#8217;s what it looks like. Go through, ask questions, to answer them, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before, we were using Gravity Forms for this. Before that, there was a completely homegrown system. That was, we were finding, kind of taking down the site under load. So we switched to Gravity Forms pretty quickly when I started just to get things stable. We could have stayed there, right? We could have kept iterating on that Gravity Forms built system that we had, but we want everything to be a block, we want everything to be under Gutenberg. So we built our quiz builder in Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give you an idea of how that works, this is a framework that we&#8217;ve played around with, to great success. I&#8217;m just calling it the controller block paradigm. So here we have one parent level block, the controller. All it does is, it stores some attributes. It doesn&#8217;t really do anything, at least on the back end here and it&#8217;s just a way for us to contain inside blocks or inner blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then within that, we have a pages block that controls the pages and a results block that controls the results. Then in each of these, you can insert any of the core blocks, headings, images, whatever, but we also have a question block and then an answer block. As you go through here, you just type out what the answer is or what the question is. You can set an image, question type, all these sort things. This is way more visual than we had, and what you build out here is what you see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a smaller example that I can show you a little bit more of what&#8217;s going on in the back end. For example, this quiz. This is a pretty simple quiz for us. This is what we call it knowledge quiz, as opposed to typology quiz, meaning there are correct answers here. So as you go through, you just click the little smiley face to determine that&#8217;s the correct answer, not correct answer. But then when we get down to the bottom here, I think this is the most exciting part, or the best example of block context, is, the results block. So here, an editor can drop in all the different things that you might see in a results page, &#8220;You scored X out of whatever, share your score.&#8221; You can build out some horizontal bar chart blocks that we&#8217;ve built out, all this sort of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we have a general response table block. Let me just run through this quiz real quick and show you how that works. So when you hit the quiz, at first, what we do is, on the back end in PHP, we&#8217;re pulling out all of the question and the answer blocks and we&#8217;re formatting it out so that you get the correct layout. None of these are going to be right. I&#8217;m going to get a terrible score, but just click through some of these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: We&#8217;re not here to judge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; No. Might have missed one. That&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You won&#8217;t be graded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Okay. So then you submit your quiz. When you submit the quiz, we store your results as an archetype rather than each individual entry. So we say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s all the possible combinations of answers. Here&#8217;s what you gave. Let&#8217;s store that.&#8221; That way, the next person that gives that possible combination of answers, we&#8217;re not duplicating database space for no reason. We just store that archetype of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you hit the quiz page again, with URL rewrite here for this archetype query bar, we go to the database, we grab that. Then through block context, we pass that through the controller block as your score. So that means that all of the blocks put in the results block, grab that context from the controller block, what the score is, and they can change accordingly. Maybe the bar chart changes to match what your score is. This thing changes to whatever your score is. Then of course the table response goes through and it gets the database entry and returns all this stuff through block context to the table block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was really exciting for us. That proved out the concept that we could do interactive things. We could build out little mini web apps, basically, for users and they could interact with them and we could construct a data model around that. So that&#8217;s our quizzes. What else do I have for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Those are pretty neat, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Chart builder. This is definitely one of the more exciting things we&#8217;ve been working on lately. We launched this in the spring and it&#8217;s a twofold project for us. One there&#8217;s the backend charting library and then there is the WordPress plugin part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me get this load again. As I mentioned, we have three developers on our team. One other developer is working with me on all this stuff. This is from one of our other developers, Ben Wormald. He spearheaded this project and it came out just fantastic. Not only did we gain the ability for editors to come in and make charts, but using the Gutenberg PHP API, we are using this in a more static database, which I&#8217;ll show you in a moment, to generate charts for that. So it provides us one endpoint for accessing charts and creating charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it starts off with a table. This one has a lot of data, just an example I threw together. We&#8217;re using block transforms here, so we can target the table block and say-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: You are using everything, you have the you have the transforms, you have-</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seth Rubenstein:&nbsp; We&#8217;re using the whole kitchen sink. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing. This is really, really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; So you can start off with the chart builder block and that&#8217;ll have a table in there and you can fill that information, or you can just start out with a table and convert that to a chart. So I&#8217;ll do that now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once again, the concept here is, you have a controller block, the builder controller, you have your table for your data. Then if we come down to the bottom here, you&#8217;ve got your chart. As you edit data, let me just see if I can change this, you&#8217;ll see that this stuff updates in real time, which is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then in the chart itself&#8230; Oops, I think this data&#8217;s not formatted for that, you can customize pretty much all the visual aspects, spacing, what type of chart it is, colors, et cetera, et cetera. Let me let this load again one more time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: So fond of live demos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t it? Isn&#8217;t it great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I was doing some the other day where I was like, &#8220;Let me make this really dramatic,&#8221; and then it broke and I was like, &#8220;Got it. Okay, cool. I found the edge.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Seth, this is independent of whatever charting library you want to use, correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; That&#8217;s correct. Yeah. I spoke about this in the thread that I posted to Twitter. Some people were asking questions about it. And that we do intend to open source the block at some point so you&#8217;ll gain the ability to convert tables to charts and then pick all your different settings that you might have, but it will be up to you to create the middleware to link that to your own charting library. We won&#8217;t be open sourcing our charting library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let me just see. I mean, we have a lot of options here. I&#8217;m not going to go through all of these. Let me just tweak some of the visual stuff for better effect. So you can tweak this however you want. We&#8217;re also using the resizing component so that you could do that visually in real time if you&#8217;d like. You can go in and give this title, test charts or a subtitle, whatever you want. So best chart builder, there&#8217;s a lot more complex things you can do with it. This is a very simple chart. To give you an idea of once again, our whole block process, let me just go to this page real quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a database that we run. It&#8217;s very exhaustive, called the religious landscape study. It has a lot of information about all the various religious groups in the United States, populations, things like this. In those, we have a lot of charts. Maps are not part of it yet, but all of these charts, all the bar charts, pie charts, and things like that, you might see that in this product are actually rendering out a block via PHP. So this is just the chart builder block being manually rendered through PHP on the back end. That way, any updates we make to chart builder for editors also get applied here to this product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s another important part to make about Gutenberg is that it&#8217;s not just in the Gutenberg editor, anything you make there, any block you make there you can also do in PHP. I think that&#8217;s important for maybe the PHP-only developers in the WordPress community to know is that, this doesn&#8217;t have to be just a JavaScript-only thing. You can utilize this using PHP as well. So that&#8217;s chart builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s all the demos I have for right now. I do have a repo I was going to share of some of the modifications that we&#8217;ve done to core blocks. So like I walk through those real quick. Let me just pull open a post, because I think that&#8217;s probably the best example of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: I would just one add one thing on chart builder. Since we do so many charts, it&#8217;s unlikely that we&#8217;re going to do all of our charts using chart builder, but for really custom-lead charts, or these data-driven acts like Seth just showed it, it&#8217;s really fantastic and we&#8217;d like to be able to use more of it when it&#8217;s appropriate for the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. No not every chart will be this, so it&#8217;s right. Yeah. Sometimes it&#8217;s just the fidelity that you go with a static chart that we just can&#8217;t achieve. I don&#8217;t know that we&#8217;d ever be able to achieve in Wizzy Wig drag-and-drop builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is an example of a post for us. Once again, what you see here is what you get. This is another block that we built out, the collapsible block. We use these at the top of all of our posts. What else was I going to show about that? Let this load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the other things that we had to build out with Gutenberg, one of the other things that Gutenberg gives you is, I think a great UI library that we&#8217;ve never really had in WordPress, with WordPress components and with inspector controls and advanced panels and stuff like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So another part of our Gutenberg journey was not just the blocks, but how are we going to utilize this editor to its fullest extent for our publishing platform? Part of that is, we&#8217;ve built out some controls for the stuff that you might see here in the sidebar. So the report PDF, top line promo, you can change these things around, you can drag and drop them just in a more visual way than you were able to before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, we used advanced custom fields for all this stuff, and that was great and all, but once again, there was only so much you could do to customize how that looked, how it worked. It had to fit in that ACF framework, but here, we&#8217;re given all those tools by Gutenberg through components to build out exactly what we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things here is, this is a block. The table contents is a block that&#8217;s being rendered out in PHP on the back end. What that also means is, that if you build out an essay or something and you want to throw a table of contents in, you can. You can just throw the table of contents block in the editor. But one of the core customizations that we had to do, we&#8217;ve done a number, is, add support to the heading block to support our table of contents block. So when you&#8217;re going through here, let&#8217;s go to&#8230; Well, actually this is using an older version of that block, not a good example, but I&#8217;ll change it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re going through here, you can type in a heading block, right? Just, and we&#8217;ve added a little icon. Not much is going on here. We&#8217;ve added one attribute called is chapter, and then we&#8217;ve added an icon to toggle that on or off. So I&#8217;m going to toggle that on. Then this might freak out because of the variety of blocks from this older post and it didn&#8217;t show up, but each of these is one of our older blocks called the chapter block, another thing we had to build out before we could figure out how we were going to book into core blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that works is&#8230; This is a high level, I&#8217;ll share this link in the chat so people can take a look at these examples. I&#8217;ve got two examples here. One is how we&#8217;ve added chapter support to headings and how we&#8217;ve added an alternate mobile background for the cover block. So that when you&#8217;re on mobile, maybe you get a different sized image for your cover block than you might get on desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the heading block is comprised of two things obviously. One is using the PHP API that Gutenberg affords is adding an attribute in. It can be very easy to do. You can just use the block type metadata filter to change a lot of things, but specifically you can splice in new attributes in this case this chapter, which is just a bullion yes or no. Then you can affect the rendering of it using the render block filter. We&#8217;re doing this in a lot of places with the core blocks. We say if you do have the chapter attribute and it&#8217;s true, then we just add a little data attribute to the H element. So that&#8217;s a very simple example. People can take a look at this and use this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another part of that obviously is the actual little toolbar icon itself. Once again, this is pretty simple too, using the filters, the JavaScript filters in Gutenberg. So you intercept the editing block. You say, Hey, if this isn&#8217;t the heading block, just give what was already there. Otherwise, we put in a little toolbar button and click it. Sets the attribute or unsets it. Then also have a variation which I alluded to. We use variations a lot as shortcuts. So you could just type in slash chapter if you wanted to and that would insert a heading with the chapter already selected. So it&#8217;s pretty easy to actually take a core block and give it completely new functionality that it didn&#8217;t have before, which I think is great. We&#8217;re trying to get more of our stuff into using core blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have any examples of this, but probably our most modified core block is the group block. We&#8217;ve added the ability to make it sticky, so that a group will stick to the top of the pages you scroll. We&#8217;ve added the ability to set a responsive threshold. When you reach set threshold, then it will move itself to this div or this idea or something that so that editors can change things around the page based on whether you&#8217;re on mobile or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other example is, in the cover block, we are adding another media field, or actually I guess, more of an ID field so that you can associate an image ID so that when you go to mobile, the cover block, we use a different version of the image. Same thing here. Intercept the block edit. You say, if you&#8217;re not the cover, just go ahead and return to what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, we have a little panel that we insert into the editor and a component that we&#8217;ve written. It&#8217;s a riff on a variety of different things in core for a drop zone for media. That&#8217;s also in this example if people want to use it. On the back end, it&#8217;s pretty simple here too. We&#8217;re using jetpack_is_mobile to detect if someone&#8217;s on mobile. If so, we get the image ID and splice it in, replace the image with that. So these are pretty easy, simple core block customizations, but I think if people dive in here, they might get a feel for what is possible for taking core blocks and making your own block library out of that basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Thanks so much for putting that in GitHub too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, no problem. No problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; But also just one last thing, this is a story in a block being rendered out in PHP. This is actually one of those full-site editing template block areas I told you about before. So we&#8217;re going to have something at the end of our sidebar. We have a little block area there that people can go into Gutenberg and drop this stuff out. Michael manages this most popular list using every usable block so that I can show up on the homepage or the sidebar anywhere else and we added it in one place and it edits everywhere. Yeah. So I think that&#8217;s all of my demos today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Yeah. We use reusable blocks in a couple of different contexts so, there&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Mm-hmm. Oh yeah. We use them at the end of posts as well for various promos, newsletter signups, this sort of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: This was an awesome demonstration. Thank you so much. I&#8217;m totally thrilled that you brought some code examples that we can share with the developers that are watching and also maybe come back to in the recorded version and want to follow up on, on some of the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Sure. No problem. Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So what are our first questions here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;ll just say I&#8217;m itching to ask a bunch of questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah. Can I jump in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I want to just drop this GitHub issue in that I think will be of interest. This is like hyper practical, but just around allowing usage of block-based template parts without actually accessing the whole template. A lot of what you&#8217;re describing with the taxonomy pages fuels very similar to that, where you can create template areas and then have access to just edit those. So that&#8217;s something I really look forward to and I see as a huge way&#8230; I&#8217;ve heard from a lot of different page agencies and organizations that&#8217;s what they&#8217;d love to have access to. It&#8217;s like we can define a template area and just allow people to edit that, that would be huge rather than opening up the whole gamut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: So I wanted to put that out there. And I definitely think you could have some really cool insights in helping shape this going forward so I want to encourage, be like, bring all your insights and all your experience of maybe what has tripped up users or what features you&#8217;d want to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: &#8230; all that good stuff. Yeah. I&#8217;d love to go back to the original, why WordPress? Was it part of wanting to rely on the open web? Was it what made you want to adopt Gutenberg? Is that also related to data consistency over time and not in the migrate stuff? I&#8217;m very curious with all the work that you do and the value brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Sure. I think I could touch on the why Gutenberg stuff real quick and I think maybe Michael can touch on the why word WordPress stuff. I&#8217;m sure that the audience here knows why WordPress. It&#8217;s, we&#8217;re all fans of it, but at the why Gutenberg front, I think that it was just kind of, I don&#8217;t know, kismet that we were looking to redo these topic pages. We were looking to make all these big editorial changes to the site and the question was, how are we going to manage all this? How are people going to slot in these different stories to these templates and so on and so forth? I think I had gone to a word camp for publishers in Chicago-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; &#8230; a couple years back, and I really didn&#8217;t know much about Gutenberg. I knew it was coming and I really hadn&#8217;t tried it out. I think I was resistant to it. I think a lot of WordPress devs were and part of the reason I made the thread is, because I think some people still are, because it really is a complete sea change for WordPress. I&#8217;m a self-taught WordPress developer and I&#8217;m only a self-taught WordPress developer because when I started in WordPress, there were frameworks, there were guidelines, coding standards, there was the WordPress way to do things so that made it easy to get in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we&#8217;re dealing with something entirely new and a completely new paradigm with blocks. So the guidelines aren&#8217;t there yet, the frameworks aren&#8217;t there yet, the Gutenberg way isn&#8217;t really well defined yet. I&#8217;m hoping that what we show here and what we give back to the community in the next couple of months as we open source more of this stuff and review more code is, we can help shape what is the Gutenberg way of doing things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi:</em> Yeah, and if-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; &#8230; yeah, it was just fortuitous that we stumbled upon it at the right time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Yeah. Going back to the earlier times, as I mentioned, when I got here, we were running every different type of CMS except for WordPress. And actually Russell and I at the time, did an analysis. And kudos to Russell too, because he really sort of pushed me in this direction, but it was open web, was part of it. We liked the open source ethos. We liked the fact that we weren&#8217;t getting charged a per user license or anything like that. So, a lot of it was commitment to opensource and it really was I think a really smart decision for us and it got us into the WordPress ecosystem. Then when Russell moved on and I was looking for a new developer, the community was really strong and we were able to find Seth and it just has always been a really good, a good fit for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing on the Gutenberg thing, I think Seth has been really great about, we don&#8217;t try to swallow the ocean at one time. As you pointed out, we dealt with the topic pages first and we roll out one little component of this thing to this one little portion of our site. As he mentioned, we&#8217;re about to bring a medium blog in-house and I think that&#8217;s going to be the first time we take our next big step with this full-site editing. So, really doing it incrementally is, I think, a really smart product ethos for us so that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s worked great for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: That&#8217;s really neat. It&#8217;s amazing to hear about both historically and just at the right time and working for publishers, folks should definitely check them out. I think two years ago went and talked to them about full siting, in the early, early, early days. So it&#8217;s neat to hear them mentioned as a way in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m curious too, because I know some folks have, I was talking to someone else this week who&#8217;s from Agencyland and how much the workflow has changed as people have adopted Gutenberg. I&#8217;m curious if that is the case with editors or people you&#8217;re working with, or it&#8217;s both a technology change and a workflow change. That&#8217;s the piece that I think often gets overlooked as people just talk about the technological change and mean to do things like learn JavaScript deeply or dig into blocks. But then I think there&#8217;s also a very real organizational way of how do you train people up in this new way or potentially have design look at things after the fact or before, and switching around the workflow. So I&#8217;d be curious to know what that&#8217;s been like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: I was&#8230; Do you mind?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Go ahead definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: One thing, I actually think to be candid, I think that&#8217;s an area we&#8217;re making sure that everybody&#8217;s on the same page, it&#8217;s an area where we&#8217;re always striving to do better. There is this tension between innovation and making sure that your editors understand what&#8217;s going on. I&#8217;m sure they would probably plus one on this. So I would say that it&#8217;s not something that we&#8217;ve really solved the problem. I think it&#8217;s common in most organizations like, so I think-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: You&#8217;re definitely not alone there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Yeah. I think it&#8217;s one thing I think we&#8217;re aspire to is doing a better job at making sure that everybody&#8217;s up to speed as we roll stuff out, but I think we do what we can. So Seth, do you want to add to that or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; I think that that is still a struggle for us, for anyone. I was listening to a Gutenberg podcast, it might have been Gutenberg Changelog or something like that a while back. There was some guest on. I think he&#8217;s the head of Florida&#8217;s state&#8217;s web properties or something. He had mentioned that what they did when they brought on Gutenberg was, they recorded a bunch of videos and snuck it into the help menu. I thought that was really clever. That&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re going to look to do by the end of the year, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been a struggle to get people to understand Gutenberg and not just the editor interface, but the concept of blocks and inner blocks and how they&#8217;ll nest together and stuff like that. We have a lot of blocks and we&#8217;ve tried a bunch of different ideas as far as interface and how you interact with these things. I think we&#8217;re finally settling on a good practice. We try to keep things in the block toolbar if you need them a lot, otherwise we hide them away in panels. There&#8217;s a fine line of when to use a block style, when should that just be a toggle on an attribute or something. That stuff&#8217;s hard to figure out and I don&#8217;t know that anyone has the right answer yet, but we&#8217;re trying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So we have one question from Matt Redford and I think it touches on that. &#8220;How do you find content editors with reusable blocks? When I&#8217;ve exposed them,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;to users before the idea that it was a global element they were inserting and changing rather than something they thought they would be duplicating, caused issues.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. It has caused issues. We had&#8230; I think there&#8217;s a lot of confusion about the difference between a reusable block and a block pattern. I know there&#8217;s a ticket. It&#8217;s been pretty active the last couple days, actually on-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Actually yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; &#8230; exploring the interface for that. I think it looks like it&#8217;s heading in the right direction to me. I&#8217;m pretty excited to see if this makes it into the plugin soon, but it&#8217;s been a problem because someone will drop in a reusable block thinking that this is like a template, a block template, and they&#8217;ll edit something. Maybe that something was a post ID attribute that told that block specific information about that post and now, every single post that was using that block is referencing that one thing. That has been a problem for us. So getting people to use block patterns I think has been harder to do. People instinctively go to the reusable blocks. I&#8217;m not sure why. Maybe it&#8217;s a little bit easier to surface, but it has been a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It was also the first concept for two, for almost three years before pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Oh, right, right. We didn&#8217;t have patterns. Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi:</em> Yeah. I think it&#8217;s a UX issue right on the admin side and communicating to the end user what you&#8217;re&#8230; Yeah. I agree with Seth. It&#8217;s something where we haven&#8217;t really looked and so, and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;ll note&#8230; Oh, sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I was going to say, one of the things that I&#8217;m really looking forward to tied to this is, block locking and adding the ability to disable editing and block locking specifically for the reusable block. This was actually looked into for 6.0 and did not make the cut, but it is something that is on the line because this is something that has come up a lot in the community is, the reasonable block, being able to edit in a way that is more intuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also where I think I saw you all using some block locking whenever you&#8217;re going through the demos, which is very neat. So I&#8217;m excited to see that system expand, but we have to make it intuitive for editors too. So if you limit options, it needs to make sense. I liked how you were doing that, where some of the options with the custom blocks that you have going already pick different headers and different image sizes. There&#8217;s a lot of interesting work being done there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. We&#8217;re using block locking in some situations. We&#8217;re also&#8230; I have found, it&#8217;s useful if you&#8217;re making a custom block that has a lot of inner blocks is, you can set the template, lock that, but unlock maybe some of the inner blocks that you want people to edit. I think that&#8217;s worked out pretty well actually to funnel people into how you want people to use this block. They click and say, &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t change that,&#8221; you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There&#8217;s something that&#8230; Just with the 13.7 version of Gutenberg plugin, you can now with one toggle actually lock all the inner blocks as well. So you don&#8217;t have to go from block to block to block, but I&#8217;m now thinking about reversing a test for that to say, &#8220;Okay, what happens if I want to edit just one block? What do I have to do?&#8221; and if that block works. It&#8217;s kind of the QA person in me, that is saying, let&#8217;s see if we can go back to the original idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, but I wanted to go back to two things. Well, it&#8217;s actually one thing. So there is this whole 10 years big, great plugins that helped out a lot of people, millions of developers. One is Gravity Forms and the other one is ACF, advanced custom fields. You said you were using them, but then moved away from it. Can you dive in that a little bit more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Sure. No shade to those plugs. I mean, Gravity Forms is phenomenal as is Advanced Custom Fields. I mean, I don&#8217;t know where we would&#8217;ve been without ACF years ago, honestly, because I think the broader, Hey, WordPress needs a field&#8217;s API stuff, stuttered out after a while and there really no movement happened there because Gutenberg was coming and ACF was great. So mad props to Eliot Condon and I guess Delicious Brains now owns them. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: They&#8217;re sold to WP Engine now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Oh, okay. Wow. Yeah. So we stuck with ACF for a while into our Gutenberg transition. I think we have a few locations where it&#8217;s still being used, taxonomy term, edit page, we&#8217;re still using ACF for some fields there, but it just made sense that for all of the stuff that was in the editor screen when you&#8217;re actually editing a post or something, to go all-in on Gutenberg. That&#8217;s the whole point of what we&#8217;re doing. We are going all-in on Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have this UI library with WordPress components and it felt like a shame not to use it. So almost all the stuff that originally was in ACF report materials, I showed you that in the block side bar, table of contents, child posts&#8230; We do a lot of reports, so we have one post and we&#8217;ll associate other posts as a child of that so they appear in the information architecture correctly. That&#8217;s now all happening using WordPress components and REST API and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there was no reason not to use ACF. There was no reason not to use Gravity Forms. It was just a matter of long term, we have to maintain these things. Everything you have to maintain, and it&#8217;s better, I think if we&#8217;re all-in on Gutenberg and the concept of blocks, to handle all that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you. So with ACF, moving away from just kind of thinking about, you would need to build a block about that. Then with the block, came the interfaces, well, the inspector control on the right hand side of the side bar?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. All right. Do we have any more questions from the audience? And do you have more questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I mean, I feel like I always have more questions. I&#8217;m curious, what&#8217;s your wish? It looks like-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we&#8217;ve got another two minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I know. Sure. It&#8217;s like, do you have anything that&#8217;s on your mind where maybe it&#8217;s really out there, but either current pain points or wishlist items far into the future? I&#8217;d be curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; I think a lot of them center around full-site editing and I haven&#8217;t gone deep into full site editing yet. That&#8217;s happening next month. As Michael said, we have a new sub-site we&#8217;re launching, so that we&#8217;re going to use that as an opportunity to learn about block themes and full-site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think if there&#8217;s one wish that I would have it is, that on the PHP side of things, of core blocks, there were more filters. The query block is a good example of this. You have to intercept the whole thing. If you want to modify it, you have to intercept the whole post template block and the WP query there, which we are doing unfortunately. I would love it if you could just tap into the query arguments before they&#8217;re sent to WP query in the query loop block and modify things. So I think probably even more PHP APIs and more endpoints that we can access through PHP would be my top wish list. I think on the JavaScript side thing, I mean, whatever you want to change is there, it&#8217;s pretty easy to do. That&#8217;s probably my biggest thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I dropped in an issue if you want to. I think it&#8217;s related to what you&#8217;re talking about, because this is also&#8230; I&#8217;ve heard from a lot of agency folks that they tend to hack apart the query block and extend it for their own purposes. So it&#8217;d be neat to gather what those main requests are, see what&#8217;s going on and see what can evolve from there, what&#8217;s missing. So that&#8217;s a great one. It&#8217;s a good call out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So there is JavaScript is one change coming. I don&#8217;t know if it will really affect you, but it is on the components. They are all now refactored with TypeScript and I think it&#8217;s a big project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So to increase the developer experience because TypeScript, then your IDE taps into that and helps you with the types of the parameters and everything. So, yeah, I just wanted to tell you, this is coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; That&#8217;ll be great. We use, many years ago now, we settled on Semantic UI as a way to bootstrap our theme redevelopment efforts. We were standardizing everything under one parent theme and we went with Semantic QI. They have a great react set of components. I actually think Microsoft hired the guy who made that to lead their TypeScript team, because they&#8217;re so good. So yeah, getting all those hints and stuff while you&#8217;re typing out those components is great so I look forward to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Okay. So I think that&#8217;s all the time we had. It has been very, very interesting and totally inspiring to think a little bit beyond what normal websites do, especially in the news side. So at this point, I only have two more questions to all three of you. So are there any announcements that you have and couldn&#8217;t get into, because we were talking other things? The other thing is, when people want to get in touch with you, how could they? What&#8217;s the best way? Michael, did you want to start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: I would just say I don&#8217;t really have any announcements, but if you want to get in touch with me, you can email me <a href="mailto:mpiccorossi@pewresearch.org">mpiccorossi@pewresearch.org</a>. You can hit me up on Twitter. Those are the two ways to do it. If you can figure out how to spell my name from Twitter, then you can M that my last name @pewresearch, you can get to me. So thank you for having us. It&#8217;s really been enjoyable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wonderful, wonderful. Seth?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, you can get ahold of me on Twitter, LinkedIn, wherever I have links or might get a profile. If you&#8217;re interested in getting in touch with me, that link for that repo is in the chat so you can find that there. And yeah, thank you for having us. It&#8217;s great to show what we&#8217;ve built. We&#8217;re very proud of it. We think we&#8217;ve built a pretty rocksolid Gutenberg news publishing system and it&#8217;s cool to show it off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Anne?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;ll close this off. I&#8217;m just going to plug the latest call for testing the cool setting outreach program I have too. So if you&#8217;re interested in the staff and whatever stage you were in, whether you&#8217;re deep in the customizations and Gutenberg first, like these folks are, or if you&#8217;re scared to adopt feedback on all this stuff and what would make it easier is really helpful, there&#8217;s a whole outreach program designed to bring that stuff in and I would love to hear about the blockers. So I just want to nudge that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, I am not really on social media. So LinkedIn, I don&#8217;t know if that counts as social media, but I&#8217;m on LinkedIn and you can also find me at nomad.blog. There&#8217;s a contact form and I welcome people to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And for those who are on the WordPress Slack, it&#8217;s on the WordPress Slack and my name, Birgit Pauli-Haack, bph on Twitter, on Slack and also <a href="mailto:pauli@gutenbergtimes.com">pauli@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. So I don&#8217;t have an announcement either, but just my brain is really full of these great demos. I&#8217;m going to watch this probably quite a few times again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking about recording, after YouTube is through the rendering, it will be on YouTube, on our Gutenberg Times channel and a big thank you to the viewers and to our panelists. It was fabulous. It&#8217;s wonderful to see that. I know there are quite a few developers on the Gutenberg team or around that are going to look for that, especially also digital strategists like Michael, to what is really possible. I think you&#8217;re really, really on the forefront on the&#8230; I&#8217;m not allowed to say that so I&#8217;m saying the leading edge of the Gutenberg development. So thank you so much.If you have questions or so, send me to <a href="mailto:pauli@gutenbergtimes.com">pauli@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. Thanks everybody and bye-bye. Let&#8217;s get out of here. Thank you. Bye-bye.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 13:18:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Birgit Pauli-Haack";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 36: Beginner’s Guide to Contributions 2.0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13162";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/episode-36-beginners-guide-to-contributions-2-0/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16313:"<p>In the thirty-sixth episode of the WordPress Briefing, Josepha Haden Chomphosy revisits the Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Contributions to the WordPress open source project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an open source software project and, like many other open source software projects, has an entire community of people who show up to help improve it however they can. Most of you probably use WordPress every day in some way. And I&#8217;m going to assume that since you listen to this podcast, you&#8217;re also interested in how this all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I mention practically every episode is that WordPress works and continues to work because of generous contributions from people all around the world. I consider my work with WordPress to be my way of giving back for everything that this software enabled me and my family to do. But I once was a first-time contributor, and I remember what it felt like before I knew everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like it moved at the speed of light and that I could never tell what to do now, let alone what to do next. And that everyone around me basically already knew everything. And if you are feeling that way right now, I encourage you to take a big deep breath [breathe] and let me help you get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:43]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a roadmap sort of person. So I&#8217;m going to start by sharing the stages I&#8217;ve observed for folks who are contributing to open source. That way, you can tell where you are right now, which spoiler alert is probably a bit further along than you realize. Then I&#8217;ll give you some questions you can ask yourself for each stage to figure out what is a good fit for you. Think of it as a guided exploration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, the five stages. So these are they:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Connecting</strong>. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first learning about the community. You know WordPress exists, but now you&#8217;ve just discovered that the community exists. That&#8217;s where you are.&nbsp;</li><li>The second phase is <strong>Understanding</strong>. It&#8217;s when you are researching the community, like, you know it exists, you think you want to give back, and so you&#8217;re trying to figure out where everything is.&nbsp;</li><li>The third phase is what I call <strong>Engaging</strong>. It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first interacting, you&#8217;ve downloaded the CMS, you have figured out which team you think you&#8217;re interested in, and you&#8217;re headed to events or meetings or whatever.&nbsp;</li><li>The fourth stage is one that I refer to as <strong>Performing</strong>. And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re gonna volunteer and you&#8217;re gonna take some action. You&#8217;re going to like a contributor day or running a release or whatever. I think that&#8217;s probably not the first place you land, running a release is probably a lot, but, you know, coordinating work on the release or something like that.&nbsp;</li><li>And then phase five, which is the <strong>Leading</strong> phase. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re taking responsibility for things getting done.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:08]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get any further, there are four important things to remember about those stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to remember is that there is no set time between any of those stages. You can start in one and then three years later go to the next one, or you can start in one and go into the next stage tomorrow. The next thing to know is that each stage builds on the one before it. In my observation, anytime I have seen a contributor who feels like they&#8217;re really struggling, it&#8217;s because they skipped a stage in there, which really causes some trouble for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing to remember is that not everyone will make it through these stages, which is okay. The majority of the community stops at three. Most contributors stop at four. And that is perfectly fine. That is expected. That is normal and completely in line with what we expect from contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and the final thing to remember about that list of the phases is that very few people make it into that leadership stage. If we assume, like I do, that 1% of the people who are using WordPress also show up and contribute back to WordPress, then it&#8217;s kind of safe to assume also that about 1% of those people who have shown up to contribute to WordPress are moving into a space where they feel like they&#8217;re willing to take responsibility for making sure things get done in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we all collectively feel responsible for WordPress&#8217;s success, but in that leadership area, you&#8217;re kind of taking responsibility for 40% of the web or whatever&#8217;s going on there. And not a lot of people make it there, and that is completely fine, too. So that&#8217;s our basic terminology today. Those are the caveats that go with our basic terminology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most difficulties that arise for new contributors happen because a stage got skipped somewhere along the way. It&#8217;s almost never intentional, but from what I&#8217;ve observed, that&#8217;s what makes it really difficult to get started and what makes it difficult to keep going once you&#8217;ve kind of already gotten in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, all right. Big breath, folks with me again [breathe]. Alright, it&#8217;s guided exploration time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First phase, the connecting phase. Remember, this is where you&#8217;ve just learned the community exists, people are talking about it, you don&#8217;t know much more. The first step for you is asking yourself what it is you could do. Or if there&#8217;s a project out there that looks particularly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:36]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can ask yourself questions, like, am I a writer? And if I am a writer, do I write technical or prose. The other thing you can ask is, am I a PHP developer, a JavaScript developer, Python, Go; which language am I writing in because I find it most beautiful. Another thing you can ask yourself is, am I a teacher or a mentor, or do I just generally like to be a mighty helper? And I like to make sure that things keep running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;ve asked yourself those things, it&#8217;s on to phase two, the understanding phase. This is when you&#8217;re looking around at this new-to-you community to see what is happening where. So you take a look at the teams that are around, you think about whatever it was you said you were good at in the last question and you look at which teams might be a good fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you said that you&#8217;re a good technical writer, then Docs probably is for you. Have you been training others to use WordPress for years? Then you might wanna look into Training. There are a lot of other things, obviously, like if you think you&#8217;re good at working with code PHP or JavaScript, you&#8217;re probably gonna end up in Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are particularly good at any of the other tech stacks that we have around in our Trac area or an Openverse, then that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll land over there. You have design options. Like if design is really your thing, we have a Design team, but we also have a Themes team. There are plenty of places that you can land depending on what it is that you feel like you are the best at and could really help the WordPress project. And so that&#8217;s your phase two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have gotten a good guess at a team, we&#8217;re gonna swing through to phase three, which is the engaging phase. This is the phase that is the scariest for most people, but it&#8217;s okay. I am here for you. I am here for you in this podcast. So you have figured out what you want to do in order to contribute, and you&#8217;ve got a sense for the team that looks right. There are two things that you do next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that you can go to a meeting. There are many kinds of meetings. There are team meetings, bug scrubs, and testing sessions, but they&#8217;re all in Slack, which means that you can attend one from anywhere. When they kick off, you wave, you introduce yourself, you let everybody know that you&#8217;re there and you&#8217;re observing. Folks will welcome you and just kind of give you some concept of what they&#8217;re working on. Easy as that. You&#8217;ve done your first time meeting attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good option is to keep an eye out for specific events. Some of those events happen online, like Global Translation Day. But also some of them happen in person like, Meetups or WordCamps. And there again, you show up, you wave, you introduce yourself, see if you can make a connection or two, let people know that you&#8217;re new and you&#8217;re just trying to figure out where you are and what you wanna do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made it now, all the way to phase four, the performing phase, then give yourself a little pat on the back! Figuring out where you want to go and who your friendly faces are is the biggest challenge when you get started. So congratulations!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:37]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase four is the phase where you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re brave enough to volunteer &#8211; to do some contribution. You&#8217;re volunteering your time. That&#8217;s where you are now. So oddly enough, you start this phase by assigning yourself something, assigning yourself, a task. This seems counterintuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this feeling that you can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re gonna do something. That you can&#8217;t just assign something to yourself and say that you&#8217;re gonna do it. But in open source projects, you always can. You find a task where you&#8217;re comfortable, and you just mention that you would like to give it a try while the team is having their weekly meeting. And it&#8217;s simple as that. And not big things either. Like organizing an event or maintaining a component, those are probably too big for your first time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking things like, &#8216;I will test that patch that you mentioned in the meeting.&#8217; Or &#8216;I will review the docs and make sure that they&#8217;re up to date with the most recent release.&#8217; Or &#8216;I can help run meetings for the next release.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have phase five, where you just repeat phase four until you are leading something! And I don&#8217;t mean leading in the 1950s sort of way, where you have like a corner office and you&#8217;re ordering people around. I mean, in the warm, inviting millennial way where you&#8217;re leading by inspiring people to do something or you&#8217;re leading because you make sure that the meeting happens every single week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you&#8217;re leading because you added screenshots to tickets that needed testing and so you moved something forward in a way that was helpful. Easy peasy. You can go to your first contributor today or a WordPress Slack meeting and just be a contributor by the time you leave, right? You might feel like ‘easy as that isn&#8217;t quite the right set of words right there. And as a matter of fact, you might be thinking to yourself, this woman is just plain wrong. It could not possibly be that easy. And I agree. It really isn&#8217;t literally quote-unquote just that easy. Just like handing someone a notebook and a pen will not instantly make them an award-winning novelist, handing someone a wordpress.org profile and credentials to Slack won&#8217;t instantly make them a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both of those examples, what makes someone good is the ability to try and fail and still be encouraged to try again. So if it&#8217;s been a while since you contributed and you&#8217;re thinking about returning, or if you&#8217;ve been listening to me for a while and you&#8217;re ready to give this contribution thing a try, I hope this helps you to feel brave enough to try and brave enough to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I encourage you to be brave enough to try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:20]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at our small list of big things. My friends, we have a Performance team. This team has been a working group for a long time and is focused on some deep, inner workings of WordPress and its surrounding ecosystem to make sure that we are as fast and slick as possible. You can check them out on make.wordpress.org/performance, their brand new site, and see when they&#8217;re meeting, what they&#8217;re aiming to get into the WordPress 6.1 release, and if that&#8217;s something that you would like to contribute to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there&#8217;s a brand new call out for testing. This time it&#8217;s focused on templates and retroactively applying them to an entire category of posts. So it&#8217;s a little bit workflow testing, a little bit technology testing, and we could really use your help in bug hunting for both of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is that you know since contribution is obviously the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, we are looking for table leads for WordCamp US’ contributor day that&#8217;s coming up in September. There&#8217;s a whole blog post about it, I&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes so that you&#8217;ll have all the info and can raise your hand if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:25]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of things that I&#8217;ll have in the show notes, I also am going to put like a contributor quizlet guide thing. If the guided, figuring out of the teams in the phase two section, if that didn&#8217;t make any sense to you and you just need something to direct you specifically to potential teams, I&#8217;m gonna link to the contributor kind of sorting hat quiz that came out with WordCamp Europe. And that should help you work your way through phase two and get ready for phase three if that is where the spirit takes you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 11:05:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Santana Inniss";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";O:42:"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary":1:{s:7:"\0*\0data";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 04:29:13 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 04:15:11 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:9:"HIT ord 1";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";}}s:5:"build";s:14:"20220806123341";}', 'no'),
